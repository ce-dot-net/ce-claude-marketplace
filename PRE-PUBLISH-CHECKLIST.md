     ../../../plugins/ace-orchestration/plugin.json
  # Restart Claude Code
  # /ace-status should work
  ```

### Package Test (Dry Run)

  cd mcp-clients/ce-ai-ace-client
  npm pack
  # Creates ce-dot-net-ace-client-3.0.0.tgz

  # Expected: 37
  ```

## üìù Publication Steps (After All Checks Pass)

### 1. Publish to npm

```bash
cd mcp-clients/ce-ai-ace-client

# Final test
npm run prepublishOnly

# Publish (do dry run first!)
npm publish --dry-run

# If dry run looks good:
npm publish --access public

# Verify publication
npm view @ce-dot-net/ace-client
```

### 2. Create Git Tag

```bash
cd ~/repos/github_com/ce-dot-net/ce-claude-marketplace

# Tag release
git tag -a v3.0.0 -m "Release v3.0.0 - TypeScript MCP Client Production Ready"

# Push tag
git push origin v3.0.0

# Push main branch (if needed)
git push origin main
```

### 3. Create GitHub Release

Go to: https://github.com/ce-dot-net/ce-claude-marketplace/releases/new

- **Tag**: v3.0.0
- **Title**: Release v3.0.0 - TypeScript MCP Client Production Ready
- **Description**: Copy from CHANGELOG.md section for v3.0.0
- **Attach**: Link to npm package

### 4. Update Plugin for Published Package

```bash
cd plugins/ace-orchestration

# Copy template to create plugin.json
cp plugin.template.json plugin.json

# Verify it uses npx
grep '"command"' plugin.json  # Should show "npx"
grep '"args"' plugin.json     # Should show "@ce-dot-net/ace-client"

# Test installation
# (Restart Claude Code and run /ace-status)
```

### 5. Test End-to-End Installation

```bash
# 1. Fresh directory
cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/ce-dot-net/ce-claude-marketplace.git test-install
cd test-install

# 2. Set environment variables
export ACE_SERVER_URL="http://localhost:9000"
export ACE_API_TOKEN="ace_wFIuXzQvaR5IVn2SoizOf-ncOKP6bmHDmocaQ3b5aWU"
export ACE_PROJECT_ID="prj_5bc0b560221052c1"

# 3. Copy template
cd plugins/ace-orchestration
cp plugin.template.json plugin.json

# 4. Install plugin
ln -sf "$(pwd)" ~/.config/claude-code/plugins/ace-orchestration

# 5. Restart Claude Code

# 6. Test
# /ace-status should work and download @ce-dot-net/ace-client from npm

# 7. Clean up
cd ~
rm -rf /tmp/test-install
```

## üö® Rollback Plan

If something goes wrong after publishing:

### npm Package Issue

```bash
# Deprecate the version
npm deprecate @ce-dot-net/ace-client@3.0.0 "Critical bug - use 3.0.1 instead"

# Fix the issue
# ... make changes ...

# Publish patch version
npm version patch  # Bumps to 3.0.1
npm publish

# Update documentation
```

### Git Tag Issue

```bash
# Delete local tag
git tag -d v3.0.0

# Delete remote tag (CAREFUL!)
git push origin :refs/tags/v3.0.0

# Fix issue and re-tag
git tag -a v3.0.0 -m "Fixed release v3.0.0"
git push origin v3.0.0
```
