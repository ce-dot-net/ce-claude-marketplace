# ACE Bootstrap

Bootstrap ACE playbook by analyzing your current codebase files and/or git commit history.

## Instructions for Claude

Call ce-ace CLI to bootstrap the playbook:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

if ! command -v ce-ace >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "❌ ce-ace not found - Install: npm install -g @ce-dot-net/ce-ace-cli"
  exit 1
fi

ORG_ID=$(jq -r '.orgId // .env.ACE_ORG_ID // empty' .claude/settings.json 2>/dev/null || echo "")
PROJECT_ID=$(jq -r '.projectId // .env.ACE_PROJECT_ID // empty' .claude/settings.json 2>/dev/null || echo "")

if [ -z "$ORG_ID" ] || [ -z "$PROJECT_ID" ]; then
  echo "❌ Run /ace-configure first"
  exit 1
fi

# Parse arguments
MODE="${1:-hybrid}"  # Default: hybrid mode
THOROUGHNESS="${2:-medium}"  # Default: medium

echo "🔄 Bootstrapping ACE playbook (mode=$MODE, thoroughness=$THOROUGHNESS)..."
echo "This may take 10-30 seconds..."

ce-ace --org "$ORG_ID" --project "$PROJECT_ID" \
  bootstrap \
  --mode "$MODE" \
  --thoroughness "$THOROUGHNESS"
```

**Data Flow**:
```
/ace-bootstrap command
    ↓
ce-ace CLI
    ↓
ACE Server: Reflector analyzes code
    ↓
MCP Tool: returns results
    ↓
Skill: queries ace_status for final counts
    ↓
Skill: generates dynamic report for user
```

**To invoke**: Simply use the bootstrap-orchestrator skill with the user's parameters.

## Usage

Use `ce-ace bootstrap` to initialize your playbook from the codebase.

**Basic usage**:
```bash
ce-ace --json --org "$ORG_ID" --project "$PROJECT_ID" bootstrap

# Or in single-org mode:
ce-ace --json --project "$PROJECT_ID" bootstrap
```

**With options**:
```bash
# Hybrid mode (recommended) - docs → git → files
ce-ace --json --project "$PROJECT_ID" bootstrap --mode hybrid --thoroughness deep

# Git history only
ce-ace --json --project "$PROJECT_ID" bootstrap --mode git-history --commit-limit 1000 --days-back 180

# Local files only
ce-ace --json --project "$PROJECT_ID" bootstrap --mode local-files --max-files 5000

# Docs only
ce-ace --json --project "$PROJECT_ID" bootstrap --mode docs-only
```

**Parameters**:
- `--mode <mode>` - Analysis mode (default: "hybrid")
  - `hybrid`: RECOMMENDED - Intelligently scan docs → git history → local files
  - `both`: Analyze current files + git history (no docs)
  - `local-files`: Current codebase files only
  - `git-history`: Git commit history only
  - `docs-only`: Documentation files only (*.md, *.txt)

- `--thoroughness <level>` - Analysis depth (default: "medium")
  - `light`: max_files=1000, commit_limit=100, days_back=30
  - `medium`: max_files=5000, commit_limit=500, days_back=90
  - `deep`: max_files=unlimited, commit_limit=1000, days_back=180

- `--repo-path <path>` - Path to repository (default: current directory)
- `--max-files <number>` - Maximum files to analyze (overrides thoroughness)
- `--commit-limit <number>` - Max commits to analyze (overrides thoroughness)
- `--days-back <number>` - Days of history to analyze (overrides thoroughness)
- `--merge` - Merge with existing playbook (default: true)

**Examples**:
```bash
# RECOMMENDED: Most comprehensive analysis
/ace:bootstrap --mode hybrid --thoroughness deep

# Good balance of speed and coverage
/ace:bootstrap --mode hybrid --thoroughness medium

# Quick local files scan
/ace:bootstrap --mode local-files --thoroughness light

# Deep git history analysis
/ace:bootstrap --mode git-history --thoroughness deep
```

## What Gets Analyzed

### Mode: hybrid (RECOMMENDED - Intelligent Multi-Source Analysis)

The **hybrid mode** uses intelligent fallback logic to extract maximum knowledge from available sources:

**Priority Order:**
1. **Check existing documentation** - Scans for CLAUDE.md, README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/*.md
2. **Analyze git history** - Extracts patterns from commits (if git repository exists)
3. **Parse local files** - Analyzes current source code files

**Intelligent Fallback Logic:**
```
IF (docs found with substantial content):
    → Extract architectural patterns, best practices, troubleshooting guides from docs
    → STILL analyze git history for bug fix patterns and refactoring insights
    → STILL scan local files for current API usage and dependencies

ELSE IF (git history available):
    → Analyze commit history for strategies, troubleshooting, API patterns
    → Scan local files for current state and dependencies

ELSE (no docs, no git):
    → Deep analysis of local files only
    → Extract patterns from code structure, imports, error handling
```

**Why Hybrid is Superior:**
- ✅ **Documentation-first**: Captures explicit team knowledge and architectural decisions
- ✅ **History-aware**: Learns from past mistakes and successful refactorings
- ✅ **Current-state**: Reflects what's actually being used right now
- ✅ **Comprehensive**: Combines all three sources for maximum coverage
- ✅ **Adaptive**: Automatically falls back based on what's available

**What Gets Extracted:**

From **Documentation** (`*.md`, `*.txt`):
- Architectural patterns and principles (→ strategies section)
- Coding standards and best practices (→ strategies section)
- Known issues and troubleshooting guides (→ troubleshooting section)
- API integration examples (→ apis section)
- Code snippets from docs (→ snippets section)

From **Git History** (commits):
- Refactoring patterns (commits with "refactor", "improve", "optimize")
- Bug fix patterns (commits with "fix", "bug", "error", "crash")
- API integration lessons (commits touching API/service/client files)
- File co-occurrence patterns (frequently changed together)
- Error resolution patterns (specific error keywords in messages)

From **Local Files** (source code):
- Current library usage and dependencies (import statements)
- Error handling patterns (try-catch, exception handling)
- Code structure and organization
- Active API integrations

**Example Output from Hybrid Mode:**
```json
{
  "mode": "HYBRID",
  "sources_analyzed": {
    "docs": {
      "files_found": 12,
      "patterns_extracted": 45
    },
    "git_history": {
      "commits_analyzed": 500,
      "patterns_extracted": 187
    },
    "local_files": {
      "files_scanned": 3421,
      "patterns_extracted": 245
    }
  },
  "total_patterns": 477,
  "by_section": {
    "strategies": 120,
    "snippets": 89,
    "troubleshooting": 178,
    "apis": 90
  }
}
```

### Mode: local-files (Current Codebase)

Analyzes **current project files** (includes uncommitted/unstaged changes):

**1. Imports & Dependencies → APIs Section**
- TypeScript/JavaScript: `import X from 'Y'`, `require('Y')`
- Python: `import X`, `from X import Y`
- Discovers what libraries you're ACTUALLY using NOW
- Example: "Project uses: express, jsonwebtoken, bcrypt"

**2. Error Handling Patterns → Troubleshooting Section**
- Try-catch patterns with console.error logging
- Try-catch with error re-throwing
- Exception handling with named exceptions (Python)
- Example: "Pattern: try-catch with console.error logging"

**3. Architecture Discovery → Strategies Section** (Future)
- Class/function structure
- Module organization
- Design patterns in use

**Why This Matters:**
- ✅ **Uncommitted code** - Captures work-in-progress and prototypes
- ✅ **Current reality** - What's actually being used, not historical experiments
- ✅ **Fast** - Client-side analysis, no git operations needed

### Mode: git-history (Historical Patterns)

Analyzes **git commit history** (server-side):

**1. Strategies** (from refactorings)
- Commits with "refactor", "improve", "optimize", "clean"
- Extracts successful architectural decisions
- Example: "Pattern from refactoring: Split monolithic service into microservices"

**2. Troubleshooting** (from bug fixes)
- Commits with "fix", "bug", "error", "crash", "issue"
- Captures common pitfalls and solutions
- Example: "Common issue: Null pointer errors in user service"

**3. APIs** (from feature additions)
- Commits touching API/service/client/interface files
- Documents API usage patterns
- Example: "API pattern: Implement JWT auth for user endpoints"

**4. File Co-occurrence**
- Files that frequently change together
- Highlights coupling and dependencies
- Example: "Files that often change together: auth.ts + user.service.ts"

**5. Error Patterns**
- Specific error keywords in commit messages
- Warns about common failure modes
- Example: "Watch out for timeout errors when calling external APIs"

**Why This Matters:**
- ✅ **Problem-solving patterns** - How bugs were fixed
- ✅ **Evolution** - What changed and why
- ✅ **Team knowledge** - Lessons from multiple contributors

### Mode: both (Current + History)

Combines **current codebase** + **git history** (without docs scanning):
- Current state (what's used NOW)
- Historical lessons (how problems were solved)
- Good when documentation is missing or sparse

**Note:** Consider using **hybrid mode** instead - it includes docs scanning AND both sources with intelligent fallback!

## Merge vs Replace

### Merge Mode (Default)
```json
{ "merge_with_existing": true }
```
- Combines new bullets with existing playbook
- Uses curator's grow-and-refine algorithm
- Deduplicates similar bullets (0.85 similarity threshold)
- Preserves helpful/harmful counters on existing bullets

**Use when:** You want to enrich existing playbook with historical patterns

### Replace Mode
```json
{ "merge_with_existing": false }
```
- Clears existing playbook
- Replaces with fresh analysis from git history
- Resets all helpful/harmful counters

**Use when:** Starting fresh or clearing bad patterns

## Example Output

```json
{
  "mode": "MERGE",
  "bullets_added": 42,
  "bullets_existing": 18,
  "bullets_final": 55,
  "by_section": {
    "strategies": 12,
    "snippets": 8,
    "troubleshooting": 25,
    "apis": 10
  }
}
```

## When to Use

### ✅ Recommended Scenarios

**Use `hybrid` mode with `thoroughness: deep`:**
- ✅ **New project onboarding**: Extract all available knowledge (docs + history + code)
- ✅ **Team knowledge capture**: Comprehensive analysis of architectural decisions
- ✅ **Post-migration**: Understand new codebase from all angles
- ✅ **Large codebases**: Maximum pattern extraction (5000+ files, 500+ commits, 90+ days)

**Use `hybrid` mode with `thoroughness: medium`:**
- ✅ **Periodic refresh**: Re-analyze every few months for new patterns
- ✅ **Medium projects**: Balanced analysis (up to 5000 files, 500 commits, 90 days)
- ✅ **Quick comprehensive scan**: Good coverage without long processing time

**Use `local-files` mode:**
- ✅ **No git history**: Project just started or not in git repo
- ✅ **Current state only**: Only care about what's being used right now
- ✅ **Fast iteration**: Quick dependency and pattern scan

**Use `git-history` mode:**
- ✅ **Legacy understanding**: Learn from how bugs were fixed and refactorings done
- ✅ **Team patterns**: Extract lessons from multiple contributors over time
- ✅ **Architectural evolution**: Understand how system design changed

**Use `docs-only` mode:**
- ✅ **Documentation exists**: Well-documented project with CLAUDE.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, etc.
- ✅ **Quick bootstrap**: Fast startup without code analysis
- ✅ **Explicit knowledge**: Team has written good documentation already

### ❌ When NOT to Use

- **Empty repository**: Need at least ~20 commits for meaningful git-history analysis
- **No sources available**: No docs, no git, and trivial codebase (< 10 files)
- **Pre-initialized playbook**: If playbook already has 100+ quality patterns, online learning is better
- **Frequent re-bootstraps**: Don't run daily - use online learning (ace_learn) instead

## Integration with ACE Agent Skills (v3.2.36)

**NEW in v3.2.36**: ACE skills now trigger on 35+ action keywords with intent-based fallback!

After bootstrapping your initial playbook, ACE's Agent Skills will automatically use these patterns during your work. The skills trigger on:

**8 Trigger Categories (35+ keywords):**
- **Implementation**: implement, build, create, add, develop, write
- **Modification**: update, modify, change, edit, enhance, extend, revise
- **Debugging**: debug, fix, troubleshoot, resolve, diagnose
- **Refactoring**: refactor, optimize, improve, restructure
- **Integration**: integrate, connect, setup, configure, install
- **Architecture**: architect, design, plan
- **Testing**: test, verify, validate
- **Operations**: deploy, migrate, upgrade

**Intent-based fallback**: Even without exact keywords, skills trigger when requests clearly intend to write/modify code, solve technical problems, make architectural decisions, or perform substantial technical work.

**How it works:**
1. **Playbook Retrieval Skill**: Before tasks (auto-invokes when trigger keywords detected)
2. **Playbook Learning Skill**: After tasks (auto-invokes after substantial work)
3. **Bootstrap command**: Provides initial patterns for skills to retrieve

**Result**: Bootstrap gives you a strong foundation, then skills automatically retrieve and expand patterns as you work!

## After Bootstrap

Once bootstrapped, ACE continues learning through **online learning**:
- Execute tasks → ACE learns from outcomes (ace_learn)
- Successful tasks → adds helpful bullets
- Failed tasks → adds troubleshooting bullets
- Counters update → helpful/harmful tracking

**Bootstrap (ace_bootstrap)** + **Online learning (ace_learn)** = Complete ACE system

## Next Steps

**After bootstrap completes:**

1. **Verify patterns loaded:**
   - Run `/ace:status` to see playbook statistics
   - Should show bullets distributed across 4 sections

2. **Review learned patterns:**
   - Run `/ace:patterns` to view what was discovered
   - Check strategies, snippets, troubleshooting, and API patterns

3. **Start coding:**
   - ACE will now retrieve these patterns before tasks
   - Automatic learning will add new patterns as you work

4. **Optional - Export backup:**
   - Run `/ace:export-patterns` to save initial playbook state
   - Useful for team sharing or restoration

## Complementary Commands

- `/ace:patterns` - View the initialized playbook
- `/ace:status` - Check statistics after initialization
- `/ace:export-patterns` - Backup before re-initialization

## Git History Requirements

**Minimum:**
- Git repository with commit history
- At least 10-20 commits

**Optimal:**
- 50+ commits over multiple weeks/months
- Descriptive commit messages
- Mix of features, refactorings, and bug fixes
- Multiple contributors (diverse patterns)

## Privacy & Security

**What gets analyzed:**
- Commit messages
- File paths
- Commit statistics (additions/deletions)

**NOT analyzed:**
- Actual file contents (unless you implement custom analysis)
- Credentials or secrets
- Private comments

**Storage:**
- Playbook stored on ACE server (configured in plugin.json)
- Project-specific (isolated by project ID)
- Multi-tenant safe (your org's patterns are private)
