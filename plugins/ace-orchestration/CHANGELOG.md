## [3.3.0] - 2025-10-31

### üîç MAJOR FEATURES: Semantic Search & Delta Operations (50-80% Token Reduction)

**Semantic Pattern Search**
- NEW `/ace-search <query>` command - Natural language pattern search
- Reduces context usage by 50-80% vs full playbook retrieval
- Returns only relevant patterns matching query intent
- Powered by MCP v3.5.0 with ChromaDB semantic search
- Example: `/ace-search "JWT authentication"` returns top 10 relevant patterns
- ~2,000-3,000 tokens vs ~12,000 tokens for full section (80% savings!)

**Top Patterns Retrieval**
- NEW `/ace-top <section> [limit]` command - Quality-first pattern retrieval
- Get highest-rated patterns by helpful score
- Filter by section and minimum helpful threshold
- Perfect for "best practices" queries
- Example: `/ace-top troubleshooting_and_pitfalls 5` returns top 5 debugging patterns

**Delta Operations**
- NEW incremental playbook updates (ACE Paper Section 3.3 compliance)
- Add, update, or delete individual bullets without full playbook refresh
- Implements grow-and-refine methodology from research paper
- Automatic deduplication and embedding updates

**Cache Management**
- NEW cache control for debugging and forced refreshes
- Clear RAM and SQLite caches on demand
- Useful for testing and cache troubleshooting

### Added

**New Slash Commands:**
- `commands/ace-search.md` - Semantic search command with examples
- `commands/ace-top.md` - Top patterns command with usage guide

**Updated Skills:**
- `skills/ace-playbook-retrieval/SKILL.md` - Added retrieval strategy section
  - Decision matrix for choosing retrieval method
  - Semantic search vs full playbook vs top patterns guidance
  - Updated examples showing token reduction

**Updated Templates:**
- `CLAUDE.md` - Added semantic search commands section (v3.3.0+)
  - Documentation for `/ace-search` and `/ace-top` commands
  - MCP tool usage examples
  - When to use each retrieval method

**MCP Tools (Requires MCP v3.5.0+):**
- `mcp__ace_search` - Semantic pattern search
- `mcp__ace_top_patterns` - Quality-first retrieval
- `mcp__ace_delta` - Incremental playbook updates
- `mcp__ace_cache_clear` - Cache management

### Changed

**Performance Improvements:**
- Targeted retrieval reduces context from ~12,000 tokens ‚Üí ~2,500 tokens (80% reduction)
- Faster pattern retrieval with semantic search
- More efficient for single-domain tasks

**Version Updates:**
- Plugin version: 3.0.0 ‚Üí 3.3.0
- MCP client dependency: Requires @ce-dot-net/ace-client@3.5.0 or higher

### Dependencies

**Required:**
- ACE MCP Client v3.5.0+ (published 2025-10-31)
- ACE Server v3.1.0+ (already deployed at https://ace-api.code-engine.app)

**Server Endpoints Used:**
- `POST /patterns/search` - Semantic search with embeddings
- `GET /patterns/top` - Top patterns by helpful score
- `POST /delta` - Delta operations for incremental updates

### Migration Guide

**For users upgrading from v3.2.x:**

1. **Automatic MCP Update**: MCP client will auto-update on next session
2. **No Breaking Changes**: All existing commands still work
3. **New Features Available**: Try `/ace-search "your query"` for targeted retrieval
4. **Recommendation**: Use semantic search for specific tasks to reduce token usage

**Backward Compatibility:**
- ‚úÖ `/ace-patterns` still works (full playbook retrieval)
- ‚úÖ Existing skill behavior unchanged (now uses semantic search when appropriate)
- ‚úÖ All previous commands remain functional

### Why This Matters

**User Impact:**
- **80% less context** for targeted pattern retrieval
- **Faster responses** with smaller playbook fetches
- **Better accuracy** with semantic matching
- **Quality filtering** via top patterns command

**Developer Impact:**
- Completes ACE Paper Section 3.3 implementation (delta operations)
- Enables incremental playbook updates
- Provides fine-grained control over pattern retrieval
- Supports context budget constraints

### Files Changed

- `plugin.PRODUCTION.json` - Version bump to 3.3.0
- `plugin.local.json` - Version bump to 3.3.0
- `CLAUDE.md` - Added semantic search commands section
- `skills/ace-playbook-retrieval/SKILL.md` - Added retrieval strategy
- `commands/ace-search.md` - NEW semantic search command
- `commands/ace-top.md` - NEW top patterns command
- `CHANGELOG.md` - This file

**This is a performance-focused release - users get massive token savings with semantic search while maintaining full backward compatibility.**

## [3.2.37] - 2025-10-30

### Added

**Script-Based ace-claude-init (90% Token Reduction)**
- New hybrid architecture combining shell scripts with LLM fallback for optimal token efficiency
- HTML marker system for precise, deterministic section detection in CLAUDE.md files
- Token savings: 20,000 ‚Üí 0 tokens for files with HTML markers (90% reduction)
- Execution time: 5-10 seconds ‚Üí <1 second for script-based updates
- Fully backward compatible with LLM fallback for files without markers

**New Components:**
- `scripts/ace-claude-init.sh` - Main hybrid update script (200 lines)
  - Detects HTML markers and uses fast script-based parsing when available
  - Falls back to LLM-based update for files without markers
  - Automatic backup creation before updates
  - Safe, idempotent operations
- `scripts/lib/section-parser.sh` - Helper library for section extraction (180 lines)
  - Fast line-based parsing using sed
  - Handles version detection and section extraction
  - Zero token consumption
- `scripts/check-ace-version.sh` - SessionStart version checker
  - Automatically detects version mismatches in project CLAUDE.md
  - Prompts user to run /ace-claude-init when outdated
  - Silent when versions match
- `scripts/ensure-gitignore.sh` - Automatic .gitignore management
  - Ensures ~/.ace/ is in project .gitignore
  - Creates .gitignore if missing
  - Idempotent, safe operations

**Auto-Update Feature:**
- Opt-in automatic CLAUDE.md updates via SessionStart hook
- User control via `/ace-orchestration:ace-enable-auto-update` command
- Conditional execution: only runs if `~/.ace/auto-update-enabled` exists
- Silent, non-intrusive updates with automatic backups
- Version checking before update prompts

**HTML Marker System:**
- `<!-- ACE_SECTION_START v3.2.37 -->` at line 1 of CLAUDE.md
- `<!-- ACE_SECTION_END v3.2.37 -->` at line 383 of CLAUDE.md
- Invisible in rendered markdown (HTML comments)
- Enables fast, deterministic parsing without LLM
- Version embedded in markers for automatic version detection

### Changed

**Updated Documentation:**
- `commands/ace-claude-init.md` - Added Step 0 (try script first, then LLM fallback)
- `commands/ace-configure.md` - Added note about automatic .gitignore management
- New `commands/ace-enable-auto-update.md` - Documentation for auto-update toggle

**Enhanced Infrastructure:**
- `hooks/hooks.json` - Added check-ace-version.sh to SessionStart hook
- Updated plugin CLAUDE.md template with HTML markers (v3.2.37)
- Updated release-manager agent with HTML marker validation rules

### Why This Matters

**Performance Gains:**
- 90% token reduction for marked files (20,000 ‚Üí 2,000 tokens average)
- Sub-second execution time for script-based updates (was 5-10 seconds)
- Reduced API costs for /ace-claude-init operations
- Better user experience with faster updates

**Reliability Improvements:**
- Deterministic parsing eliminates LLM variability
- Automatic backups prevent data loss
- Safe, idempotent operations
- Backward compatibility with LLM fallback

**User Experience:**
- Optional auto-update reduces manual intervention
- Version checking prevents outdated documentation
- Transparent operation with clear feedback
- User control via enable/disable command

### Breaking Changes

None - fully backward compatible with LLM fallback for files without HTML markers

### Technical Details

**Script-Based Parsing:**
```bash
# Fast section extraction using sed
sed -n '/^<!-- ACE_SECTION_START v/,/^<!-- ACE_SECTION_END v/p' CLAUDE.md
```

**Version Detection:**
```bash
# Extract version from markers
grep -o "ACE_SECTION_START v[0-9.]*" | cut -d' ' -f2
```

**Fallback Logic:**
```bash
# Try script first, fall back to LLM if needed
if has_markers; then
  use_script_based_update
else
  use_llm_based_update
fi
```

### Files Added
- `scripts/ace-claude-init.sh`
- `scripts/lib/section-parser.sh`
- `scripts/check-ace-version.sh`
- `scripts/ensure-gitignore.sh`
- `commands/ace-enable-auto-update.md`

### Files Updated
- `commands/ace-claude-init.md`
- `commands/ace-configure.md`
- `hooks/hooks.json`
- `CLAUDE.md` (added HTML markers at lines 1 and 383)

## [3.2.36] - 2025-10-29

### Added
- **Expanded Trigger Word Coverage** - Added 14 new trigger words for more reliable skill invocation
  - **New words**: write, update, modify, change, edit, enhance, extend, revise, test, verify, validate, deploy, migrate, upgrade, install
  - **Total coverage**: 35 trigger words (was 21) across 8 categories
  - **Categories**: Implementation, Modification, Debugging, Refactoring, Integration, Architecture, Testing, Operations

- **Intent-Based Fallback Rule** - Skills now trigger on semantic intent even without exact keywords
  - Triggers on: code modification, technical problem-solving, architectural decisions, API/tool work
  - Skips: simple Q&A, informational queries, basic file reading
  - Example: "Can you help with the authentication flow?" now triggers (was missing "implement")

### Changed
- **Updated skill descriptions** - Both ace-playbook-retrieval and ace-learning now have expanded trigger lists
  - Retrieval skill: Added all 35 trigger words + intent rule to frontmatter
  - Learning skill: Added all 35 trigger words (gerund form) + intent rule to frontmatter

- **Enhanced PRE-FLIGHT CHECK** - Step 1 now includes intent-based evaluation
  - Checks for explicit keywords OR semantic intent to write/modify code
  - More comprehensive than keyword-only matching

- **Improved documentation** - All CLAUDE.md files updated with categorized trigger words
  - Better organized by purpose (Implementation, Debugging, Testing, etc.)
  - Clear examples of intent-based triggering
  - Explains when to use fallback rule

### Why This Matters
- **Higher reliability**: Skills trigger more consistently across diverse user requests
- **Better UX**: Users don't need to use exact "magic words" to activate ACE
- **Semantic understanding**: Claude can evaluate intent, not just keywords
- **Backward compatible**: All existing triggers still work exactly as before

### Impact
- Users who say "update the auth code" will now trigger retrieval (was missing before)
- Users who say "write tests" will now trigger learning (was missing before)
- Users who say "can you add" will now trigger reliably (was inconsistent before)
- Reduces false negatives (missed opportunities) significantly

## [3.2.28] - 2025-10-29

### Fixed
- **Update CLAUDE.md template to document UserPromptSubmit hook**
  - Added documentation for per-prompt enforcement (UserPromptSubmit)
  - Updated workflow examples to show both SessionStart and UserPromptSubmit
  - Clarified that enforcement happens on EVERY prompt, not just session start
  - Template now accurately reflects v3.2.27 hook architecture

### Why This Was Missing
- v3.2.27 added UserPromptSubmit hook but didn't update CLAUDE.md template
- Users running `/ace-claude-init` would get outdated documentation
- Template only mentioned SessionStart hook (once per session)
- Missing information about per-prompt enforcement guarantee

### What's Fixed
- ‚úÖ CLAUDE.md now documents both SessionStart and UserPromptSubmit hooks
- ‚úÖ Workflow examples show per-prompt enforcement cycle
- ‚úÖ Note explains continuous enforcement throughout session
- ‚úÖ `/ace-claude-init` now copies correct documentation to projects

## [3.2.27] - 2025-10-29

### Added
- **CRITICAL: UserPromptSubmit hook for per-prompt enforcement**
  - Adds ACE protocol enforcement on EVERY single user prompt
  - Ensures skills are triggered even in long-running sessions
  - Prevents context collapse and protocol forgetting
  - Aligns with ACE Research Paper's online adaptation model

### Why This Is Critical
- SessionStart hook runs ONCE at session start
- In long conversations, context can be compacted/forgotten
- Model-invoked skills alone are unreliable (keyword-dependent)
- UserPromptSubmit ensures FRESH enforcement on EVERY prompt
- Implements true "online" adaptation per ACE paper (test-time memory adaptation)

### What's Improved
- ‚úÖ ACE protocol injected on EVERY prompt (not just session start)
- ‚úÖ Works throughout entire session, regardless of length
- ‚úÖ No reliance on context persistence or model decision-making
- ‚úÖ Guarantees playbook retrieval before tasks and learning after tasks
- ‚úÖ Aligns with ACE paper: "online settings (e.g., test-time memory adaptation)"

### Files Added
- `hooks/ace-prompt-enforcement.sh` - Per-prompt enforcement script

### Files Updated
- `hooks/hooks.json` - Added UserPromptSubmit hook

## [3.2.26] - 2025-10-29

### Fixed
- **Fix SessionStart hooks validation error**
  - Added missing `matcher` field to SessionStart hooks
  - Wrapped hook commands in `hooks` array
  - SessionStart events support matchers: `startup`, `resume`, `clear`, `compact`
  - Structure now matches official Claude Code hooks specification

### Why This Was Broken
- SessionStart hooks were missing required structure
- Error: "Required" for `hooks` field at path `["hooks","SessionStart",0,"hooks"]`
- SessionStart is an event that USES matchers (like PostToolUse)
- Incorrect structure prevented hooks from loading

### What's Fixed
- ‚úÖ SessionStart hooks now have correct structure with `matcher` and `hooks` array
- ‚úÖ Validation passes - no "Required" errors
- ‚úÖ Hooks load successfully in Claude Code
- ‚úÖ SessionStart enforcement now runs on startup

## [3.2.25] - 2025-10-29

### Fixed
- **Remove unnecessary manifest fields that break plugin validation**
  - Removed `commands`, `agents`, `skills` fields from plugin.json
  - These directories are auto-discovered by Claude Code (default locations)
  - Validation error: "agents: Invalid input: must end with .md"
  - Only specify custom paths (hooks, mcpServers) in manifest
  - Plugin now loads without validation errors

### Why This Was Broken
- Plugin.json was explicitly specifying default directories
- Claude Code auto-discovers `commands/`, `agents/`, `skills/` directories
- Explicit paths in manifest are for **additional** locations beyond defaults
- `agents` field triggered validation requiring `.md` files
- We only had `agents/README.md` (not an agent definition)

### What's Fixed
- ‚úÖ Plugin.json now only specifies custom paths (hooks, mcpServers)
- ‚úÖ Default directories auto-discovered without explicit declaration
- ‚úÖ Validation passes - no "must end with .md" error
- ‚úÖ Plugin loads successfully in Claude Code

## [3.2.24] - 2025-10-29

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Commit plugin.json to repository (required for strict mode)**
  - Marketplace plugins require `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` by default (`strict: true`)
  - Plugin.json does NOT contain credentials (those are in `.mcp.json`)
  - Updated `.gitignore` to ignore `.mcp.json` (has credentials) but allow `plugin.json`
  - Plugin now loads correctly when installed from marketplace

### Why This Was Broken
- Previously had `plugin.json` in `.gitignore`
- Result: Plugin installed from marketplace had NO `plugin.json` file
- Without `plugin.json`: Plugin doesn't load (strict mode requires it)
- Without plugin loading: Hooks don't register, skills don't enforce

### What's Fixed
- ‚úÖ `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` now committed to repository
- ‚úÖ `.gitignore` updated: blocks `.mcp.json` (credentials), allows `plugin.json` (safe)
- ‚úÖ Marketplace installations will have `plugin.json` present
- ‚úÖ Plugin loads correctly ‚Üí Hooks register ‚Üí Skills enforce ‚Üí MCP calls work

### Security Note
**Safe to commit**: `plugin.json` references external `.mcp.json` file, doesn't contain credentials itself. Only `.mcp.json` needs to stay in `.gitignore`.

## [3.2.23] - 2025-10-29

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Plugin structure corrected to match Claude Code specification**
  - Moved `plugin.json` from plugin root to `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (official location)
  - Moved `plugin.template.json` to `.claude-plugin/plugin.template.json`
  - Updated `.gitignore` to reflect new path: `plugins/*/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`

### Why This Fix Is Critical
- **Root cause**: Plugin was not loading because `plugin.json` was in wrong location
- **Result**: Hooks weren't registered ‚Üí Skills weren't enforcing ‚Üí MCP not called ‚Üí ACE cycle broken
- **According to Claude Code docs**: "There is only one `plugin.json` file, located in the `.claude-plugin/` directory at the plugin root."
- **Now**: Plugin loads correctly ‚Üí Hooks register ‚Üí SessionStart enforcement works ‚Üí Skills invoke ‚Üí MCP calls happen

### What Was Broken (v3.2.0 - v3.2.22)
- Plugin structure did not match official specification
- Hooks defined in `hooks/hooks.json` were not being registered
- SessionStart hook enforcement was never injecting context
- Skills were relying solely on model-invoked description matching (unreliable)
- Zero ACE framework interaction in actual sessions

### What's Fixed (v3.2.23+)
- Plugin structure now matches official Claude Code specification
- Hooks will be properly registered when plugin loads
- SessionStart enforcement will inject MANDATORY protocol into context
- Skills will be consistently invoked based on trigger keywords
- Complete ACE cycle: retrieval ‚Üí execution ‚Üí learning

### Migration for Users
If you installed v3.2.0-v3.2.22, the plugin needs to reload with correct structure:
```bash
# Claude Code will automatically use the new structure
# Just update the plugin in the marketplace
```

## [3.2.22] - 2025-10-29

### Changed
- **CLAUDE.md template simplified** - Removed redundant checkpoint sections
  - Deleted "‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL CHECKPOINT - BEFORE STARTING WORK" section (~10 lines)
  - Deleted "‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL CHECKPOINT - AFTER COMPLETING WORK" section (~20 lines)
  - Replaced with "üö® AUTOMATIC: ACE Skill Enforcement" section
  - Explains that SessionStart hook now provides enforcement
  - Reduced token usage while maintaining documentation value

### Why This Change
- v3.2.21 introduced SessionStart hook for system-level enforcement
- CLAUDE.md checkpoints are now redundant (hook enforces automatically)
- Simpler CLAUDE.md = less tokens = more room for actual context
- Hook enforcement is STRONGER than CLAUDE.md reminders

### What Was Removed
- Manual checkpoint questions (replaced by automatic hook enforcement)
- "YOU MUST" behavioral reminders (now system-enforced)
- Redundant trigger keyword lists (already in hook)

### What Was Added
- Clear explanation that enforcement is now automatic
- Documentation of how the SessionStart hook works
- Note that skills are truly non-optional (system-level)

### Migration
- Users running `/ace-claude-init` will get the simplified v3.2.22 template
- Existing projects with v3.2.20/v3.2.21 CLAUDE.md will continue to work
- Recommended: Run `/ace-claude-init` to update to cleaner template

## [3.2.21] - 2025-10-29

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Skills now ACTUALLY auto-invoke using SessionStart hook enforcement
  - Added `hooks/ace-skill-enforcement.sh` - Injects MANDATORY skill protocol into every session's context
  - SessionStart hook output gets added to Claude's context BEFORE any user messages
  - This is STRONGER than CLAUDE.md checkpoints (which can be ignored)
  - This is STRONGER than skill descriptions (which are behavioral suggestions)
  - NOW: Context includes system-level MANDATORY instructions that cannot be bypassed

### Why Previous Fixes Failed
- v3.2.19: Added checkpoints to CLAUDE.md - behavioral reminders, can be ignored
- v3.2.20: Added checkpoints to both skills - still behavioral, not enforced
- **Root Cause**: Model-invoked skills with behavioral reminders are NOT reliable
- **Real Solution**: SessionStart hook injects MANDATORY protocol into system context

### Added
- `hooks/ace-skill-enforcement.sh` - Session start enforcement script
  - Outputs MANDATORY skill invocation protocol
  - Gets added to Claude's context at session start (per hooks docs)
  - Lists all trigger keywords explicitly
  - Explains consequences of skipping skills

### Changed
- Updated `hooks/hooks.json` - Added skill enforcement hook as first SessionStart hook
- Updated `hooks/ace-version-check.sh` - Use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` instead of hardcoded path
- SessionStart hooks now run in order: enforcement ‚Üí version check

### How It Works Now
1. Session starts
2. SessionStart hook runs ace-skill-enforcement.sh
3. Hook output gets injected into Claude's context (per Claude Code hooks spec)
4. Claude sees MANDATORY protocol before processing any user messages
5. Skills MUST be invoked - no longer optional

## [3.2.20] - 2025-10-29

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Restored balance between BEFORE and AFTER skill checkpoints
  - v3.2.19 added checkpoint only for ace-learning (AFTER), creating imbalance
  - ace-playbook-retrieval (BEFORE) was inadvertently de-emphasized
  - Result: Retrieval skill stopped auto-invoking at task start
- Added matching "‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL CHECKPOINT" to ace-playbook-retrieval skill
- Added "‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL CHECKPOINT - BEFORE STARTING WORK" section to CLAUDE.md
- Renamed existing checkpoint to "‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL CHECKPOINT - AFTER COMPLETING WORK" for clarity

### Why This Matters
- **Complete learning cycle requires BOTH skills**: retrieval (before) ‚Üí execution ‚Üí learning (after)
- v3.2.19 broke the cycle by over-emphasizing the AFTER skill
- Users reported: "the initial getting pattern skill is not running anymore"
- This fix restores equal emphasis on both timing checkpoints

### Changed
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` with balanced checkpoints (lines 29-38: BEFORE, lines 47-65: AFTER)
- Updated `skills/ace-playbook-retrieval/SKILL.md` with checkpoint section (lines 27-36)

## [3.2.19] - 2025-10-29

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Added explicit checkpoint reminders to ace-learning skill to ensure auto-invocation after every substantial task
- Added "‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL CHECKPOINT" section to `skills/ace-learning/SKILL.md` with 3 checkpoint questions
- Added matching checkpoint reminder to `CLAUDE.md` template that gets distributed via `/ace-claude-init`
- Ensures complete learning cycle (retrieval ‚Üí execution ‚Üí learning) runs consistently

### Why This Matters
- Previous behavior would sometimes skip learning skill invocation, breaking the ACE learning cycle
- This fix ensures every substantial task completion triggers pattern capture
- Critical for maintaining the self-improving behavior of the ACE framework
- Learning skill should invoke IMMEDIATELY after work completion, BEFORE responding to user

### Changed
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` versions to v3.2.19 (lines 71, 305) to reflect current release

## [3.2.18] - 2025-10-28

### Changed
- **Bootstrap Orchestrator Skill** - Updated to use BootstrapResponse directly from ACE Server v2.9.0
  - Eliminated redundant `ace_status` API call (reduced from 7 to 6 steps)
  - Uses server-calculated `compression_percentage` and `analysis_time_seconds`
  - Simplified API flow: `ace_bootstrap` now returns complete BootstrapResponse
- **API Evolution** - Aligned with ACE Server v2.9.0's new `/bootstrap` endpoint structure
  - Server now calculates compression metrics (was client-side calculation)
  - Added `analysis_time_seconds` to show processing duration
  - More accurate and consistent compression reporting

### Improved
- **Performance** - One fewer API call during bootstrap process
- **Accuracy** - Server-side compression calculation eliminates client-side formula drift

## [3.2.17] - 2025-10-28

### Added
- **Bootstrap Orchestrator Skill** - New skill for intelligent bootstrap reporting
  - Automatically calculates pattern compression percentage (e.g., 158 ‚Üí 18 = 89% reduction)
  - Shows conditional explanation when compression > 80% (references ACE Research Paper Section 3.2)
  - Displays progress messages during 10-30 second bootstrap analysis
  - Uses actual numbers from `ace_status` API, not hardcoded examples
  - Explains semantic deduplication: similar patterns merged into core patterns
  - File: `skills/bootstrap-orchestrator/SKILL.md` (143 lines, 7-step orchestration process)
- **Data Flow Diagram in ace-bootstrap.md** - Visual ASCII diagram showing bootstrap pipeline
  - Shows: Command ‚Üí Skill ‚Üí MCP Tool ‚Üí ACE Server ‚Üí Reflector ‚Üí Results ‚Üí Report

### Changed
- **ace-bootstrap command** - Now invokes bootstrap-orchestrator skill instead of calling MCP tool directly
  - Better user experience with dynamic reporting
  - Eliminates confusion about pattern compression (users thought it was a bug)
  - Clear explanation that quality > quantity is intentional design

### Improved
- **User Experience** - Users now understand why 158 code blocks ‚Üí 12 patterns
  - Before: "Is this a bug?" (confusion)
  - After: "Ah, semantic deduplication - makes sense!" (clarity)

## [3.2.16] - 2025-10-27

### Fixed
- **CLAUDE.md bootstrap documentation** - Fixed incorrect bootstrap command references
  - Updated documentation to reflect current bootstrap behavior
  - Clarified hybrid mode as default with intelligent fallback

## [3.2.15] - 2025-10-27

### Added
- **Hybrid Bootstrap Mode** - Intelligent multi-source analysis with fallback logic
  - Priority order: docs ‚Üí git history ‚Üí local files
  - Extracts patterns from documentation files (CLAUDE.md, README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/*.md)
  - Falls back to git history and local files if docs are missing or sparse
  - Comprehensive coverage: combines all three sources for maximum pattern extraction
- **Thoroughness Parameter** - Control bootstrap depth with light/medium/deep settings
  - Light: 1000 files, 100 commits, 30 days
  - Medium: 5000 files, 500 commits, 90 days (default)
  - Deep: unlimited files, 1000 commits, 180 days
- **5x Deeper Defaults** - Increased default limits for more comprehensive analysis
  - max_files: 500 ‚Üí 5000 (10x increase)
  - commit_limit: 100 ‚Üí 500 (5x increase)
  - days_back: 30 ‚Üí 90 (3x increase)

### Changed
- **Enhanced bootstrap documentation** - Complete guide for all bootstrap modes
  - Detailed explanation of hybrid mode's intelligent fallback logic
  - Clear examples for each thoroughness level
  - Updated usage examples with new parameters
- **Project-scoped configuration** - Clarified that ACE config is per-project
  - Each project needs its own `.ace/config.json`
  - Configuration stored in project root, not globally

### Fixed
- **plugin.template.json version mismatch** - Corrected version number inconsistency

### Removed
- **Obsolete mcp-server directory** - Cleaned up old MCP server files from plugin

## [3.2.14] - 2025-10-26

### Added
- **SessionStart hook for automatic version detection** - Detects plugin version on session start
  - Logs plugin version for debugging
  - Helps troubleshoot version-related issues

### Changed
- **Documentation cleanup** - Removed internal development references
  - Removed research paper references from public-facing docs
  - Cleaned up technical README to remove deleted file references
  - Added docs-internal/ to gitignore for private development docs
  - Removed internal docs and added .serena to gitignore

## [3.2.7] - 2025-10-23

### Fixed
- **`/ace-claude-init` command implementation** - CRITICAL BUG FIX: Command was broken in v3.2.6
  - **Problem**: Used `@` reference syntax which doesn't work in command expansion
  - **Solution**: Now properly copies full plugin CLAUDE.md content inline (~289 lines)
  - **Impact**: v3.2.6 users got broken command that didn't inject instructions
  - Command now works as documented: copies content inline, no `@` references
  - Non-destructive: appends to existing CLAUDE.md without overwriting user content
  - Idempotent: detects existing content and prevents duplicates
  - Creates CLAUDE.md if it doesn't exist

## [3.2.6] - 2025-10-23 [BROKEN - DO NOT USE]

**WARNING**: This version contains a broken `/ace-claude-init` command. Please use v3.2.7 instead.

### Added
- **`/ace-claude-init` command** - BROKEN: Used `@` reference syntax instead of inline copy
  - Intended to copy full ACE plugin instructions inline into project CLAUDE.md
  - Provides always-on context about ACE architecture and automatic learning cycle (~289 lines)
  - Non-destructive: appends to existing CLAUDE.md without overwriting user content
  - Idempotent: detects existing content and prevents duplicates
  - Creates CLAUDE.md if it doesn't exist
  - Replaces unreliable SessionStart hook approach with explicit user control
  - **BUG**: Implementation used `@` reference syntax which doesn't work - FIXED IN v3.2.7
- **Local file analysis in `/ace-bootstrap`** - NEW: Analyze current project files (committed or uncommitted!)
  - Three modes: `local-files`, `git-history`, or `both` (default)
  - Extracts imports/dependencies from TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Go, Java, Ruby files
  - Discovers error handling patterns (try-catch, error logging)
  - Captures work-in-progress and prototype code (uncommitted changes)
  - Client-side analysis (fast, no git operations needed)
  - Configurable file extensions and max files limit
- **Enhanced bootstrap documentation** - Complete guide for local file analysis
  - Detailed explanation of what gets analyzed in each mode
  - Examples for different use cases (prototyping, current state, historical patterns)
  - Why local files matter (uncommitted code, current reality vs. historical experiments)

### Changed
- **Renamed `/ace-init` to `/ace-bootstrap`** - More accurate name for bootstrapping playbook
  - Clearer purpose: "bootstrap" indicates initializing from existing data
  - Distinguishes from new `/ace-claude-init` which initializes CLAUDE.md
  - Tool name: `mcp__ace-pattern-learning__ace_init` ‚Üí `mcp__ace-pattern-learning__ace_bootstrap`
  - All documentation updated to reflect new command name
- **Updated MCP Client to v3.2.6** - Includes local file analysis capabilities
  - New `analyzeLocalFiles()` function for client-side file scanning
  - Recursive directory traversal with common ignore patterns
  - Regex-based pattern extraction for imports and error handling
  - Sends extracted patterns to server via `ace_learn` execution trace
- **Updated installation workflow** - Now includes `/ace-claude-init` as Step 7 (one-time setup)
  - Provides explicit user control over CLAUDE.md patching
  - More reliable than automatic SessionStart hook injection
  - Follows official Claude Code plugin patterns (no CLAUDE.md auto-injection)

### Removed
- **SessionStart hook** - Removed automatic CLAUDE.md injection (replaced by `/ace-claude-init`)
  - Unreliable: hook structure issues prevented consistent execution
  - Not official: Plugin CLAUDE.md auto-injection not in official Anthropic spec
  - User control: Explicit command is more transparent and reliable
- **auto-inject-instructions.sh script** - No longer needed with new manual command approach

### Fixed
- **Reliable CLAUDE.md setup** - Users now have explicit, reliable command to initialize ACE instructions
  - Solves SessionStart hook failures across different environments
  - Works every time (file operation vs. hook execution)
  - User can verify what was added
- **Bootstrap now captures uncommitted work** - Major improvement over git-only analysis
  - Prototypes and WIP features no longer missed
  - Current architecture/dependencies captured accurately
  - What's ACTUALLY being used NOW vs. historical experiments

## [3.2.5] - 2025-10-23

### Fixed
- **SessionStart hook structure** - Fixed nested hooks array that prevented auto-inject-instructions.sh from running
  - Changed from incorrect nested structure `{"hooks": [{"type": "command", ...}]}` to correct flat structure `{"type": "command", ...}`
  - This resolves the issue where plugin CLAUDE.md reference was not being injected into project CLAUDE.md files after session restart
  - PostToolUse hook structure was already correct (uses matcher, so nesting is valid)

## [3.2.4] - 2025-10-23

  - `claude-code-skills-patterns.md` - Skills best practices and patterns

### Changed
- **Updated to MCP Client v3.2.4** - Includes .mcp.json using @latest for automatic npm updates
- **Simplified hooks.json** - Removed redundant learning reminders (skills now handle automation)
  - SessionStart hook: Simplified to basic instructions only
  - PostToolUse hook: Removed learning reminders (ACE Learning skill handles this)
- **Enhanced CLAUDE.md** - Complete documentation of automatic learning cycle
  - Added detailed section on ACE Playbook Retrieval skill
  - Documented 3-tier caching architecture (RAM ‚Üí SQLite ‚Üí Server)
