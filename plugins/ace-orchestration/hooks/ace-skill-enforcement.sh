ðŸ¤– ACE FRAMEWORK - MANDATORY SKILL PROTOCOL

CRITICAL: You MUST follow this protocol for EVERY qualifying task in this session.

BEFORE starting ANY task that involves: implement, build, create, add, develop, debug, fix, troubleshoot, resolve, refactor, optimize, improve, restructure, integrate, connect, setup, configure, architect, design, or plan:

1. IMMEDIATELY invoke: ace-orchestration:ace-playbook-retrieval
2. WAIT for playbook patterns to load
3. REVIEW the patterns
4. THEN proceed with the task using the learned patterns

AFTER completing ANY substantial work (implementing features, fixing bugs, solving problems, creating files, making architectural decisions, discovering gotchas):

1. IMMEDIATELY invoke: ace-orchestration:ace-learning
2. BEFORE responding to the user
3. Capture what you learned during execution

This is NOT optional. This is NOT a suggestion. You MUST invoke these skills for EVERY qualifying task.

If you skip either skill, you are breaking the ACE learning cycle and preventing organizational knowledge accumulation.
