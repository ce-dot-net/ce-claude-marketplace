# ACE Orchestration Plugin

This plugin provides automatic pattern learning using the ACE (Adaptive Context Evolution) framework.

## How It Works

**ACE helps Claude learn from your codebase over time:**

1. **Before complex tasks** - Retrieve relevant patterns from past work
2. **During execution** - Apply proven strategies and avoid known pitfalls
3. **After completion** - Capture new patterns for future use

Over time, the system builds organizational knowledge that compounds with each project session.

## Automatic Learning Cycle

ACE uses **two subagents** that run in separate contexts:

### ACE Retrieval Subagent (Before Work)

**When it runs**: Before implementation, debugging, refactoring, or architectural tasks

**What it does**:
- Searches the ACE playbook for relevant patterns
- Returns 2-5 key insights to inform your work
- Uses semantic search for 50-92% token efficiency

**You'll see**: `[ACE Retrieval] Searching playbook for patterns...`

**Triggers**: implement, build, create, fix, debug, refactor, optimize, integrate, architect, test, deploy, etc.

### ACE Learning Subagent (After Work)

**When it runs**: After substantial work completion (implementation, bug fixes, refactoring)

**What it does**:
- Captures lessons learned from the work
- Sends execution trace to ACE server
- Updates playbook for future retrieval

**You'll see**: `[ACE Learning] Captured 3 new patterns`

**Triggers**: Work completion with valuable lessons (successes AND failures)

## 🚨 ACE Workflow (Enforced by Hooks)

ACE uses **automated hooks** to ensure proper workflow compliance:

**Automatic Reminders**:
- **Before implementation work**: Hook detects keywords and reminds you to invoke ACE Retrieval
- **During substantial work**: Hook tracks file edits and reminds you to invoke ACE Learning
- **Before compaction**: Hook issues urgent reminder if Learning wasn't invoked

**Your Role**:
- **Respond to hook reminders** by invoking the requested subagent (Task tool)
- **Review retrieved patterns** from ACE Retrieval and apply relevant ones
- **Report pattern usage** to ACE Learning when capturing lessons

**Note**: Hooks guarantee you won't forget workflow steps. Just follow the reminders!

## The Playbook

The ACE playbook has 4 sections:

1. **strategies_and_hard_rules** - Architectural patterns, coding principles
2. **useful_code_snippets** - Reusable code patterns with context
3. **troubleshooting_and_pitfalls** - Known issues, gotchas, solutions
4. **apis_to_use** - Recommended libraries, frameworks, integration patterns

Patterns accumulate helpful/harmful scores based on usage feedback.

## Setup

### First-Time Setup

1. **Configure connection**:
   ```
   /ace-orchestration:ace-configure
   ```
   Sets up server URL, API token, and project ID.

2. **Bootstrap initial patterns** (optional but recommended):
   ```
   /ace-orchestration:ace-bootstrap --mode hybrid --thoroughness deep
   ```
   Extracts patterns from docs, git history, and current code.

3. **Start coding**: Subagents auto-invoke when relevant.

### Manual Commands

View and manage patterns:
- `/ace-orchestration:ace-patterns` - View full playbook
- `/ace-orchestration:ace-search <query>` - Semantic search
- `/ace-orchestration:ace-top <section>` - Highest-rated patterns
- `/ace-orchestration:ace-status` - Statistics and health check

Configuration:
- `/ace-orchestration:ace-configure` - Setup wizard
- `/ace-orchestration:ace-tune` - Runtime configuration
- `/ace-orchestration:ace-doctor` - Diagnostic tool

## Disabling ACE

ACE subagents are **optional and controllable**. To disable:

**Temporary** (current session):
- Simply tell Claude: "Don't use ACE subagents for this task"

**Permanent** (remove from plugin):
1. Delete `agents/ace-retrieval.md` (disables retrieval)
2. Delete `agents/ace-learning.md` (disables learning)
3. Or disable entire plugin: `/plugin disable ace-orchestration`

**Re-enable**: Restore agent files or re-enable plugin.

## Architecture

**ACE Framework Components**:
- **Generator**: Main Claude instance (executing tasks)
- **Playbook**: Learned patterns (retrieved before work)
- **Reflector**: Server-side Sonnet 4 (analyzes execution traces)
- **Curator**: Server-side Haiku 4.5 (creates pattern updates)
- **Merge**: Non-LLM algorithm (applies incremental updates)

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Automatic learning from execution feedback
- ✅ Token-efficient retrieval (50-92% reduction vs full playbook)
- ✅ Transparent operation (see subagents running)
- ✅ Separate contexts (won't block other plugins)
- ✅ Self-improving over time

## Example Workflow

```
User: "Implement JWT authentication"
    ↓
[ACE Retrieval] Searching playbook...
[ACE Retrieval] Returns JSON with 3 patterns:
  {
    "patterns": [
      {"id": "ctx-xxx", "content": "Refresh token rotation prevents theft", "helpful": 8, "evidence": [...]},
      {"id": "ctx-yyy", "content": "HttpOnly cookies for refresh tokens", "helpful": 6, "evidence": [...]},
      {"id": "ctx-zzz", "content": "Rate limiting for auth endpoints", "helpful": 5, "evidence": [...]}
    ]
  }
    ↓
Claude reviews JSON patterns:
  - Prioritizes by helpful score (ctx-xxx: 8 > ctx-yyy: 6 > ctx-zzz: 5)
  - Checks evidence arrays for implementation details
  - Notes pattern IDs for later reporting
    ↓
Claude implements using patterns ctx-xxx, ctx-yyy, ctx-zzz
    ↓
[ACE Learning] Asks Claude which patterns were used
Claude responds: "Used ctx-xxx, ctx-yyy, ctx-zzz"
[ACE Learning] Captures new patterns + reports pattern usage
✅ Saved to playbook + pattern effectiveness tracked
    ↓
Next session: Enhanced playbook with usage data!
```

## Workflow Enforcement (v4.2.1+)

**Three-tier hook system ensures ACE workflow compliance:**

### 1. Pre-Implementation Check
- **Hook**: `enforce-ace-retrieval.py` (UserPromptSubmit)
- **Trigger**: Implementation keywords in user prompt
- **Action**: Reminds to invoke ACE Retrieval if not already done

### 2. During-Work Tracking
- **Hook**: `track-substantial-work.py` (PostToolUse)
- **Trigger**: 3+ file edits in recent 50 messages
- **Action**: Reminds to invoke ACE Learning after substantial work

### 3. Pre-Compaction Safety
- **Hook**: `pre-compact-ace-learning.py` (PreCompact)
- **Trigger**: Conversation compaction with uncaptured patterns
- **Action**: Urgent reminder to invoke Learning before trace is lost

### Benefits
- Deterministic workflow enforcement
- Prevents empty playbook
- Non-blocking reminders (never breaks workflow)

**Opt-out**: Delete hook files from `hooks/` directory
