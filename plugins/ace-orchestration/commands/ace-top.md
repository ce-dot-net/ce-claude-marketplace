# ACE Top Patterns

Retrieve proven patterns with the highest helpful scores - battle-tested patterns that have proven successful.

## What This Does

Returns patterns sorted by helpful score (upvotes from successful usage), giving you quality-first retrieval instead of quantity.

## Instructions for Claude

When the user runs `/ace-top [section] [limit]`, call the MCP tool:

```bash
mcp__plugin_ace-orchestration_ace-pattern-learning__ace_top_patterns(
  section="<optional section>",
  limit=<optional limit>,
  min_helpful=<optional threshold>
)
```

### Parameters

- **section** (optional): Filter to specific playbook section
  - Values: `strategies_and_hard_rules`, `useful_code_snippets`, `troubleshooting_and_pitfalls`, `apis_to_use`
  - Default: All sections
- **limit** (optional): Maximum patterns to return
  - Default: 10
  - Range: 1-50
- **min_helpful** (optional): Minimum helpful score threshold
  - Default: 0
  - Use `5` for only highly-rated patterns

### Example Usage

```bash
/ace-top
→ Returns top 10 patterns across all sections

/ace-top strategies_and_hard_rules
→ Returns top 10 architectural patterns/principles

/ace-top troubleshooting_and_pitfalls 5
→ Returns top 5 troubleshooting patterns

/ace-top apis_to_use 20 3
→ Returns top 20 API recommendations with helpful >= 3
```

### When to Use This

✅ **Use `/ace-top` when**:
- You want proven, high-quality patterns
- You're asking for "best practices"
- You need patterns that have been validated through use
- You want quick access to most valuable knowledge

❌ **Don't use when**:
- You have a specific query (use `/ace-search` instead)
- You need comprehensive coverage (use `/ace-patterns` instead)
- You're looking for something specific (semantic search is better)

## Output Format

The tool returns JSON with top-rated patterns:

```json
{
  "patterns": [
    {
      "content": "Always use refresh token rotation to prevent theft attacks",
      "helpful": 12,
      "harmful": 0,
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "section": "strategies_and_hard_rules",
      "observations": 15,
      "evidence": [
        "Prevented auth bypass in 3 projects",
        "Industry standard per OWASP recommendations"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "section": "strategies_and_hard_rules",
  "count": 10,
  "min_helpful": 5
}
```

Patterns are sorted by helpful score (descending).

## Helpful Score Interpretation

- **0-2**: New pattern, not yet validated
- **3-5**: Moderately proven, used successfully a few times
- **6-10**: Well-proven, reliable pattern
- **11+**: Highly validated, cornerstone pattern

Patterns with `harmful > 0` indicate they've had negative feedback and should be used cautiously.

## Performance Impact

Similar to semantic search - retrieves only top patterns instead of full playbook:

- Token usage: ~2,000-4,000 tokens (vs ~15,000 for full)
- **60-75% token reduction**
- Fast retrieval with quality guarantee

## Use Cases

**Architecture questions**:
```
/ace-top strategies_and_hard_rules 10
→ "What are the best architectural patterns we've learned?"
```

**Debugging help**:
```
/ace-top troubleshooting_and_pitfalls 5
→ "What are the most common issues we've encountered?"
```

**Library selection**:
```
/ace-top apis_to_use 10 5
→ "What libraries have we had success with?"
```
