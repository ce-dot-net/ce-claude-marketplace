# Configure ACE Connection

Interactive configuration wizard for ACE server connection.

## Instructions for Claude

When the user runs `/ace-configure`, follow these steps:

1. **Ask for Server URL:**
   - Prompt: "What is your ACE server URL? (default: http://localhost:9000)"
   - If blank, use: `http://localhost:9000`

2. **Ask for API Token:**
   - Prompt: "What is your ACE API token? (Get from your ACE server logs or dashboard)"
   - Required - must start with `ace_`

3. **Ask for Project ID:**
   - Prompt: "What is your ACE project ID? (Get from your ACE server dashboard)"
   - Required - usually starts with `prj_`

4. **Save Configuration to PROJECT ROOT (NOT user home):**
   - IMPORTANT: Save to project root, NOT `~/.ace/`!
   - Find the project root using: `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` (or use current directory if not in git)
   - Create `.ace` directory in project root if it doesn't exist: `mkdir -p .ace`
   - Write configuration to **PROJECT-LEVEL** `.ace/config.json` with the provided values:
     ```json
     {
       "serverUrl": "[provided URL]",
       "apiToken": "[provided token]",
       "projectId": "[provided project ID]"
     }
     ```
   - DO NOT write to `~/.ace/config.json` (that's the global fallback, not the primary location)
   - Use the Write tool with an absolute path like: `/path/to/project/.ace/config.json`
   - Show success message with the FULL config file path

5. **Next Steps:**
   - Tell user to restart Claude Code for changes to take effect
   - Suggest running `/ace-status` to verify connection

## Example Interaction

```
User: /ace-configure

Claude: I'll help you configure your ACE server connection.

[Claude finds project root]
üìÇ Project root: /Users/you/my-project

What is your ACE server URL? (default: http://localhost:9000)
User: [press Enter or type URL]

What is your ACE API token? (Get from your ACE server logs)
User: ace_your_api_token_here

What is your ACE project ID? (Get from your ACE server dashboard)
User: prj_your_project_id

[Claude writes config file to PROJECT ROOT - NOT user home]

‚úÖ Configuration saved to: /Users/you/my-project/.ace/config.json

‚ö†Ô∏è  Note: Config was saved to PROJECT root, not ~/.ace/
    This ensures your team can share the same ACE server configuration.

Next steps:
1. Restart Claude Code (Cmd+Q, then reopen)
2. Run: /ace-status to verify connection
3. Consider adding .ace/config.json to .gitignore if it contains sensitive tokens
```

## Configuration Storage

**ACE is project-scoped:** Configuration MUST be saved to project root (`./.ace/config.json`):
```json
{
  "serverUrl": "http://localhost:9000",
  "apiToken": "ace_your_api_token_here",
  "projectId": "prj_your_project_id"
}
```

**Location**: `.ace/config.json` in your git repository root (or current directory if not in a git repo)

**Why project-scoped only:**
- ‚úÖ Each project has its own ACE playbook (learned patterns are project-specific)
- ‚úÖ Each project can use different ACE servers or credentials
- ‚úÖ Configuration travels with the repository
- ‚úÖ Team members automatically share the same ACE server
- ‚úÖ No global state - clean separation between projects

## Alternative: Environment Variables

You can also set configuration via environment variables:
```bash
export ACE_SERVER_URL="http://localhost:9000"
export ACE_API_TOKEN="ace_your_api_token_here"
export ACE_PROJECT_ID="prj_your_project_id"
```

Add to `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc` to persist across sessions.

## Alternative: Claude Code Settings

You can add to `~/.config/claude-code/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "env": {
    "ACE_SERVER_URL": "http://localhost:9000",
    "ACE_API_TOKEN": "ace_your_api_token_here",
    "ACE_PROJECT_ID": "prj_your_project_id"
  }
}
```

## Configuration Priority

**IMPORTANT:** ACE is **project-scoped only**. Each project has its own ACE configuration and playbook.

The MCP client checks for configuration in this order:
1. Environment variables (`ACE_SERVER_URL`, `ACE_API_TOKEN`, `ACE_PROJECT_ID`) - highest priority
2. **Project-level config**: `<project-root>/.ace/config.json` - **REQUIRED for file-based config**
3. Claude Code settings.json (`~/.config/claude-code/settings.json`)
4. Default values (lowest priority)

**There is NO global `~/.ace/config.json` fallback.** ACE is designed to be project-scoped - each repository has its own configuration and learned patterns.

## Getting Your Credentials

### Server URL
Your ACE server URL. If running locally:
- Default: `http://localhost:9000`
- Check your ACE server logs for the correct port

### API Token
Generated by your ACE server on first start. Check:
- Server logs: Look for "API Token: ace_xxxxx"
- Server admin panel
- Ask your team's ACE administrator

### Project ID
Your project identifier in ACE. Check:
- ACE dashboard
- Server admin panel
- Ask your team's ACE administrator

## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot connect to ACE server"
1. Check server URL is correct: `curl http://localhost:9000/api/health`
2. Verify ACE server is running
3. Check firewall settings

### "Authentication failed"
1. Verify API token is correct
2. Check token hasn't expired
3. Generate new token from ACE server

### "Project not found"
1. Verify project ID exists in ACE server
2. Check you have access to the project
3. Create new project in ACE dashboard

- `/ace-init` - Initialize pattern discovery

## Running the Configuration

This command runs an interactive wizard that prompts for your ACE server details and saves the configuration to your project directory.

## Testing the Configuration

After saving, test your connection:

```bash
/ace-status
```

This will show if ACE server is reachable and authenticated.

## Manual Configuration

If you prefer to configure manually, create `.ace/config.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "serverUrl": "http://localhost:9000",
  "apiToken": "ace_xxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "projectId": "prj_xxxxxxxxxxxxx"
}
```

## Getting Your Credentials

### 1. Server URL

Your ACE server URL. Common values:
- Local development: `http://localhost:9000`
- Remote server: `https://ace.yourcompany.com`

### 2. API Token

Generated by ACE server. Find it in:
- Server startup logs: `"API Token: ace_xxxxx"`
- Server dashboard under Settings > API Keys
- Ask your team's ACE administrator

### 3. Project ID

Your project identifier. Find it in:
- ACE dashboard project list
- Server admin panel
- Ask your team's ACE administrator

## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot save configuration"

**If saving to project root fails:**
```bash
# Check write permissions
ls -la .ace/

# Create directory manually if needed
mkdir -p .ace
chmod 755 .ace
```

**Note:** There is NO global `~/.ace/config.json` file in ACE's design. If you have one, it's likely a leftover from testing or incorrect configuration. ACE is project-scoped only - each project must have its own `.ace/config.json` file.

### "Connection test failed"

1. Verify server URL: `curl http://localhost:9000/api/health`
2. Check ACE server is running
3. Verify firewall allows connection

### "Authentication failed"

1. Check API token is correct (no extra spaces)
2. Token may have expired - generate new one
3. Verify token has correct permissions
