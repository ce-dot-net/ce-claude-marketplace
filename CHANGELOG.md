## [3.2.33] - 2025-10-29

### 🎯 FINAL FIX: Restore v3.2.18 Skill Descriptions with MAXIMUM Enforcement

**THE REAL PROBLEM: Skill descriptions were weakened in later versions**

After v3.2.32 still didn't work, we discovered the KEY DIFFERENCE:

**v3.2.18 Skill Descriptions (WORKED):**
- Retrieval: `"PROACTIVELY use this skill BEFORE implementation tasks. YOU MUST retrieve playbook patterns when user says implement, build, debug, fix, refactor..."`
- Learning: `"YOU MUST ALWAYS use this skill IMMEDIATELY AFTER you finish ANY substantial work. MANDATORY trigger: when you have COMPLETED implementing..."`

**v3.2.30+ Skill Descriptions (TOO SOFT):**
- Retrieval: `"Retrieve learned strategies, code patterns, and troubleshooting solutions before implementation tasks."`
- Learning: `"Capture execution patterns and lessons after completing coding tasks."`

### What Changed

**ALL THREE FILES restored to v3.2.18 exact content:**
1. ✅ `CLAUDE.md` - MANDATORY section with "YOU MUST" language
2. ✅ `skills/ace-playbook-retrieval/SKILL.md` - PROACTIVELY + YOU MUST in description
3. ✅ `skills/ace-learning/SKILL.md` - YOU MUST ALWAYS + MANDATORY TRIGGER in description

### Why This Matters

Model-invoked skills are triggered based on **skill description matching**. The description field is the FIRST thing Claude sees when deciding whether to invoke a skill. Soft descriptions = probabilistic invocation. MANDATORY descriptions = reliable invocation.

**v3.2.18 Working Formula:**
- CLAUDE.md: "YOU MUST FOLLOW THESE RULES"
- Skill descriptions: "YOU MUST", "PROACTIVELY", "MANDATORY", "IMMEDIATELY AFTER", "DO NOT WAIT"
- Result: Skills invoke reliably IN THE RIGHT ORDER

This is the COMPLETE restoration of v3.2.18 that was proven to work.

## [3.2.32] - 2025-10-29

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Restore MANDATORY Skill Enforcement

**FIXED: Skills now invoke reliably with imperative CLAUDE.md instructions**

This release restores the MANDATORY enforcement from v3.2.18 that was working, after v3.2.31's "Recommended" approach proved too soft to reliably trigger skills.

### What Changed

**CLAUDE.md Template** (Restored v3.2.18 MANDATORY section):
- ✅ **MANDATORY protocol**: "YOU MUST FOLLOW THIS PROTOCOL FOR EVERY CODING TASK"
- ✅ **Imperative language**: "ALWAYS invoke", "STEP 1", "STEP 2"
- ✅ **IN THIS ORDER**: Explicit sequencing (retrieval BEFORE work, learning AFTER)
- ✅ **Clear requirements**: Lists exact trigger keywords that REQUIRE skill invocation
- ✅ **Critical explanation**: Why this order matters (research paper architecture requirement)

### Why This Was Needed

**v3.2.31 Problem:**
- Used "Recommended ACE Workflow" with soft language
- Claude didn't consistently invoke skills even with workflow guidance
- Users reported: "oke it doesnt seem to start he skills"

**v3.2.18 Success:**
- Used "MANDATORY: ACE Skill Usage Rules" with imperative language
- Skills invoked reliably with "YOU MUST" instructions
- Worked in production environments

**Technical Reality:**
Model-invoked skills are probabilistic by design. Official Claude Code docs say skills are "model-invoked - Claude autonomously decides when to use them". However, in practice, skills need strong CLAUDE.md prompting to invoke consistently. The research paper used template injection (`{{ playbook }}`), but Claude Code doesn't support that - we must use persistent instructions instead.

### The Fix

Restored v3.2.18's MANDATORY section structure:
```markdown
## 🚨 MANDATORY: ACE Skill Usage Protocol

**YOU MUST FOLLOW THIS PROTOCOL FOR EVERY CODING TASK:**

### Before ANY Implementation, Debugging, or Refactoring Task:

**STEP 1: ALWAYS invoke the ACE Playbook Retrieval skill FIRST:**
```
Skill: ace-orchestration:ace-playbook-retrieval
```

**You MUST call this skill BEFORE starting work when the user's request
contains ANY of these keywords.**

### After ANY Substantial Coding Task:

**STEP 2: ALWAYS invoke the ACE Learning skill AFTER completion:**
```
Skill: ace-orchestration:ace-learning
```

**Critical**: These skills are NOT optional. You MUST use them proactively
IN THIS ORDER for every qualifying task.
```

### Why This Works

1. **Imperative language**: "YOU MUST", "ALWAYS", "STEP 1/2" - clear commands
2. **Explicit ordering**: "BEFORE starting work", "AFTER completion" - temporal clarity
3. **Listed triggers**: Concrete keywords that REQUIRE invocation
4. **Architecture rationale**: Explains WHY order matters (Generator needs playbook BEFORE reasoning)
5. **Non-negotiable framing**: "NOT optional", "MUST use proactively"

This gives Claude persistent, unambiguous instructions that skills MUST invoke in the correct order.

### Files Modified

- `plugins/ace-orchestration/CLAUDE.md` - Restored MANDATORY enforcement section

### Expected Impact

Claude instances using this CLAUDE.md template (via `/ace-claude-init`) will now:
- **ALWAYS** invoke ace-playbook-retrieval BEFORE implementation tasks
- **ALWAYS** invoke ace-learning AFTER substantial work completion
- Follow the correct order required by ACE research paper architecture
- Build and use the playbook consistently across sessions

This ensures the complete ACE training cycle operates correctly: Retrieval → Execution → Feedback → Analysis → Result.

## [3.2.31] - 2025-10-29

### ✨ ENHANCED: CLAUDE.md Workflow Guidance for Research Paper Alignment

**CRITICAL: Added recommended workflow to ensure playbook retrieval BEFORE tasks**

This release adds workflow guidance to CLAUDE.md template to align with the ACE research paper requirement that playbook context be available to the Generator BEFORE starting tasks.

### What Changed

**CLAUDE.md Template** (New "Recommended ACE Workflow" section):
- ✅ **Step-by-step workflow**: Clear guidance on when to invoke skills
- ✅ **Research paper alignment**: "The playbook should be available to the Generator BEFORE starting tasks"
- ✅ **Concrete trigger phrases**: Examples like "Implement [feature]", "Fix [bug]", "Debug [issue]"
- ✅ **Completion indicators**: Clear signals for when to capture learning
- ✅ **Why it matters**: Explains the complete ACE training cycle from research paper
- ✅ **Natural framing**: "Recommended" not "MANDATORY" (respects official Claude Code guidance)

### Technical Rationale

**Research Paper Finding:**
The ACE paper shows playbook content injected directly into Generator prompt via `{{ playbook }}` template variable. This ensures patterns are ALWAYS available before reasoning begins.

**Official Claude Code Guidance:**
- Skills are model-invoked (probabilistic, not deterministic)
- CLAUDE.md should contain "project conventions" and "common workflows" (official docs)
- Skill descriptions should use natural, third-person language (not "YOU MUST")

**Hybrid Solution:**
- Keep natural skill descriptions (v3.2.30) - respects official best practices
- Add workflow guidance to CLAUDE.md - leverages project instructions for consistency
- Frame as "recommended workflow" not enforcement - aligns with CLAUDE.md purpose
- Includes trigger phrases and examples - helps Claude recognize when to invoke skills

### Why This Works

1. **Respects Official Docs**: Uses CLAUDE.md for its intended purpose (project workflows)
2. **Maintains Natural Skills**: Skill descriptions remain descriptive, not prescriptive
3. **Research Paper Alignment**: Ensures playbook context available BEFORE tasks
4. **Clear Guidance**: Concrete examples help Claude recognize appropriate timing

### Files Modified

- `plugins/ace-orchestration/CLAUDE.md` - Added "🎯 Recommended ACE Workflow" section

### Expected Impact

Claude instances using this CLAUDE.md template (via `/ace-claude-init`) will have clear workflow guidance showing:
- When to retrieve playbook patterns (before implementation tasks)
- When to capture learning (after substantial work)
- Why this pattern matters (complete ACE training cycle)

This increases the probability of correct skill invocation timing while respecting model-invoked architecture.

## [3.2.30] - 2025-10-29

### ✨ OPTIMIZED: Skills + CLAUDE.md Following Official Best Practices

**ENHANCED: Maximum skill invocation probability + ACE research paper alignment**

This release applies official Claude Code best practices from the Agent Skills documentation to maximize skill invocation reliability while staying true to the ACE research paper architecture.

### What Changed

**Skill Descriptions** (Official best practices applied):
- ✅ **Specific trigger keywords**: Added concrete terms users would mention
- ✅ **Both WHAT and WHEN**: Clear capabilities + use cases
- ✅ **Consistent terminology**: Strategies, patterns, trajectory throughout
- ✅ **Concise yet complete**: Under 1024 chars, all key info present
- ✅ **Natural language matching**: Removed command-style ("YOU MUST"), added descriptive

**ace-playbook-retrieval**:
```yaml
description: Retrieve learned strategies, code patterns, and troubleshooting
solutions before implementation tasks. Use when starting: feature implementation,
bug fixes, API integration, code refactoring, architecture decisions, debugging
issues, performance optimization. Provides project-specific strategies, tested
code snippets, known pitfalls, and recommended libraries from past work.
```

**ace-learning**:
```yaml
description: Capture execution patterns and lessons after completing coding tasks.
Use after: implementing features, fixing bugs, debugging issues, integrating APIs,
refactoring code, discovering gotchas, solving technical problems, making
architectural decisions. Analyzes trajectory, extracts insights, updates playbook
with strategies, code patterns, troubleshooting tips, and API recommendations.
```

**CLAUDE.md Template** (ACE research paper aligned):
- ✅ **Research paper terminology**: Generator, Reflector, Curator explicitly mentioned
- ✅ **Training cycle goal**: Clear explanation of feedback loop
- ✅ **Complete flow diagram**: Shows 5-step ACE cycle (Retrieval → Execution → Feedback → Analysis → Result)
- ✅ **Generator role emphasized**: "Highlight which patterns were useful or misleading"
- ✅ **MCP → Server flow**: Documents complete feedback chain

### Technical Rationale

**From Official Agent Skills Documentation**:
> "Description should include both what the skill does and when to use it"
> "Be specific - include key terms users would mention"
> "Consistent terminology helps Claude understand and follow instructions"

**From ACE Research Paper**:
> "When solving new problems, the Generator highlights which bullets were
> useful or misleading, providing feedback that guides the Reflector"

This release bridges Claude Code's model-invoked architecture with ACE's feedback-driven learning cycle.

### Architecture Flow

```

- ✅ **Official best practices**: Follows Claude docs recommendations
- ✅ **Complete ACE cycle**: Retrieval → Learning → Server analysis documented
- ✅ **No hooks needed**: Pure model-invoked probabilistic architecture
- ✅ **Progressive learning**: Each task improves future performance (+10.6% on agentic tasks per paper)

### Migration

1. **Update marketplace**: `/marketplace update`
2. **Update project CLAUDE.md**: `/ace-claude-init`
3. Skills will invoke with higher probability based on optimized descriptions

## [3.2.29] - 2025-10-29

### 🔧 CRITICAL FIX: Removed ALL Hooks - Pure Model-Invoked

**FIXED: Skills now invoke naturally based on context matching**

### What Broke

On October 23rd (commit 2891651, v3.2.8), we introduced "Mandatory Skill Triggering with Aggressive Prompting":
1. **Made skill descriptions prescriptive** ("YOU MUST", "MANDATORY") instead of descriptive
2. **Later added bash script enforcement hooks** (v3.2.21+) to try to force invocation
3. **Added UserPromptSubmit enforcement** (v3.2.27) to make it even more aggressive

Result: Despite increasingly aggressive enforcement, skills STILL stopped auto-invoking consistently because descriptions became commands rather than natural context matchers.

### What We Fixed

**Hooks** (removed - rely on CLAUDE.md template instead):
- ✅ **REMOVED all ACE-related hooks** (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, Stop, SubagentStop)
- ✅ Removed enforcement scripts (`ace-prompt-enforcement.sh`, `ace-skill-enforcement.sh`)
- ✅ Only kept Bash logging PostToolUse hook for execution tracking
- ✅ **Rely entirely on CLAUDE.md template** (copied via `/ace-claude-init`)
- ✅ Skills invoke naturally based on description matching (model-invoked architecture)

**Skill Descriptions** (restored v3.2.4 natural approach):
- ✅ **ace-playbook-retrieval**: Reverted to v3.2.4 descriptive style (before October 23rd breaking change)
  - v3.2.4 (worked): "Automatically retrieve ACE playbook patterns before substantial coding tasks..."
  - v3.2.8-3.2.28 (broken): "YOU MUST retrieve playbook patterns when user says..."
  - v3.2.29 (fixed): "Retrieves learned patterns from the ACE playbook before starting implementation..."
- ✅ **ace-learning**: Simplified to describe WHAT it does and WHEN to use it
  - v3.2.4 (worked): Natural description of what it does
  - v3.2.8-3.2.28 (broken): "MANDATORY trigger: when you have COMPLETED implementing..."
  - v3.2.29 (fixed): "Captures patterns and lessons learned after completing substantial coding tasks..."

### Technical Rationale

From official Claude Code documentation:
> **"Claude discovers Skills from the description field"**
> **"The description should include: What the Skill does and When Claude should use it (specific trigger terms)"**
> **"Vague descriptions prevent discovery. Specific ones work better"**

Key insight: Skills are **model-invoked** - Claude decides when to use them based on **context matching**, not commands.

### Architecture

```
User: "Implement JWT authentication"
    ↓
Skill Description Matching: Claude recognizes "implement" keyword in context
    ↓
ace-playbook-retrieval Auto-Invokes (model decision based on natural description)
    ↓
Task Execution: Uses retrieved patterns
    ↓
Stop Hook: Gentle reminder about learning capture
    ↓
ace-learning Auto-Invokes (model decision based on task context)
```

### Files Changed

- `hooks/hooks.json`: **Removed ALL ACE hooks** - only Bash logging remains
- `skills/ace-playbook-retrieval/SKILL.md`: Natural description for context matching
- `skills/ace-learning/SKILL.md`: Natural description for context matching
- `CLAUDE.md`: Updated template - NO HOOKS, pure model-invoked approach
- **Removed**: All ACE enforcement scripts (clean minimalist design)

### Benefits

- ✅ **Natural invocation**: Skills trigger based on task context, not forced commands
- ✅ **Aligned with Claude Code architecture**: Model-invoked by design
- ✅ **Cleaner codebase**: Removed unnecessary enforcement scripts
- ✅ **Better UX**: Gentle reminders instead of aggressive "YOU MUST" commands
- ✅ **Proven approach**: Restored v3.1.11 working implementation

### Migration

**For existing users**: Run `/ace-claude-init` to update your project's CLAUDE.md with the new template.

## [3.2.18] - 2025-10-28

### 🔄 API Alignment: Bootstrap Response Structure

**ENHANCED: bootstrap-orchestrator skill aligns with ACE Server v2.9.0 response structure**

### What Changed

**Simplified Bootstrap Flow**:
- ✅ Removed separate `ace_status` API call (no longer needed)
- ✅ Uses `BootstrapResponse` directly from `ace_bootstrap` MCP tool
- ✅ Server now pre-calculates compression percentage
- ✅ Added processing time metric (`analysis_time_seconds`)
- ✅ Reduced step count from 7 to 6 steps

### Technical Details

**Before (v3.2.17)**:
```
1. Call ace_bootstrap
2. Call ace_status separately
3. Manually calculate compression: (1 - patterns/blocks) * 100
4. Generate report
```

**After (v3.2.18)**:
```
1. Call ace_bootstrap
2. Use response.compression_percentage (server-calculated)
3. Use response.analysis_time_seconds
4. Use response.by_section for breakdown
5. Generate report
```

### Benefits

- ✅ **Simpler**: One API call instead of two
- ✅ **More Accurate**: Server calculates compression percentage
- ✅ **Better UX**: Shows analysis processing time
- ✅ **Cleaner Code**: Uses structured response fields

### Server Compatibility

- **Requires**: ACE Server v2.9.0+ (deployed to https://ace-api.code-engine.app)
- **Reference**: Based on `/private/tmp/PLUGIN_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`

### Files Modified

- `plugins/ace-orchestration/skills/bootstrap-orchestrator/SKILL.md`

### BootstrapResponse Structure

```typescript
interface BootstrapResponse {
  success: boolean;
  blocks_received: number;          // e.g., 158
  patterns_extracted: number;        // e.g., 12
  compression_percentage: number;    // e.g., 92 (pre-calculated!)
  by_section: {
    strategies_and_hard_rules: number;
    useful_code_snippets: number;
    troubleshooting_and_pitfalls: number;
    apis_to_use: number;
  };
  average_confidence: number;        // e.g., 0.85
  analysis_time_seconds: number;     // NEW: e.g., 12.45
}
```

### Upgrade Notes

No breaking changes - existing users can upgrade seamlessly. Just pull the latest version and restart Claude Code CLI.

## [3.2.10] - 2025-10-23

### Bug Fix - Trajectory Format Documentation

**FIXED: ACE Learning skill documentation now shows correct trajectory format**

### The Problem

The ACE Learning skill (`ace-learning`) documentation showed `trajectory` parameter as a string:
```json
{
  "trajectory": "1. Step one\n2. Step two\n3. Step three"
}
```

But the ACE server actually requires an **array of objects**:
```json
{
  "trajectory": [
    {"step": "Analysis", "action": "Analyzed the problem"},
    {"step": "Implementation", "action": "Implemented the solution"}
  ]
}
```

This caused **422 validation errors** when users followed the documentation examples.

### What Changed

**Updated Documentation Files:**
- ✅ `plugins/ace-orchestration/skills/ace-learning/SKILL.md` - All 3 examples fixed
- ✅ `plugins/ace-orchestration/CLAUDE.md` - Manual tool usage example fixed (line 272-283)
- ✅ `plugins/ace-orchestration/commands/ace-claude-init.md` - Line counts updated (340 → 344)

**Added Clear Warning:**
- Line 83 in SKILL.md: **"IMPORTANT: Must be an array of objects"**
- Line 283 in CLAUDE.md: Clear note about trajectory format requirement

**Updated Version:**
- CLAUDE.md header: v3.2.6 → v3.2.10 (for version detection)
- Line count: 344 lines (includes trajectory fix)

### Benefits

- ✅ No more 422 errors when following documentation
- ✅ Clear examples showing correct array of objects format
- ✅ IMPORTANT warning prevents confusion
- ✅ All examples consistent across documentation
- ✅ Users who run `/ace-claude-init` get correct docs

### Files Affected

```
plugins/ace-orchestration/
├── CLAUDE.md (344 lines, v3.2.10)
├── skills/ace-learning/SKILL.md (trajectory examples fixed)
└── commands/ace-claude-init.md (line counts updated)
```

### Upgrade Notes

**For existing users:**
- Run `/ace-claude-init` in your project
- If you have v3.2.9 or older, it will offer to update
- Accept the update to get corrected trajectory examples

**For new users:**
- Fresh installs automatically get correct documentation

## [3.2.9] - 2025-10-23

### Feature - Version Detection & Auto-Update for `/ace-claude-init`

**ENHANCED: /ace-claude-init now detects and offers to update outdated ACE content**

### The Problem

Users who installed ACE before v3.2.8 had outdated CLAUDE.md content:
- Missing 🚨 MANDATORY: ACE Skill Usage Rules section
- Old version documentation (e.g., v3.2.6, v3.2.7)
- Running `/ace-claude-init` again would say "already initialized" and exit
- Manual editing required to get latest features

### What Changed

**Smart Version Detection:**
- `/ace-claude-init` now detects ACE version in project CLAUDE.md
- Compares with current plugin version
- Identifies outdated installations automatically

**User-Friendly Update Process:**
- Shows: "Your project has ACE v3.2.6, but plugin is v3.2.9. Would you like to update? (y/n)"
- If yes: Replaces only ACE section (preserves other content)
- If no: Exits without changes
- Shows what version → what version

**Non-Destructive:**
- Finds ACE section boundaries precisely
- Preserves all content before/after ACE section
- Only updates ACE-related content
- All user customizations kept intact

### Benefits

- ✅ Easy updates: Just run `/ace-claude-init` again
- ✅ Safe: Asks confirmation before changes
- ✅ Smart: Only updates ACE section
- ✅ Clear: Shows version upgrade path
- ✅ Users get latest features (like MANDATORY section)

### Example Flow

```
User runs: /ace-claude-init
Claude: "🔍 Detected ACE v3.2.6 in your CLAUDE.md"
Claude: "📦 Plugin has ACE v3.2.9 available"
Claude: "Would you like to update? (y/n)"
User: y
Claude: "✅ Updated! ACE v3.2.6 → v3.2.9"
Claude: "Added: 🚨 MANDATORY section for better skill triggering"
```

### Files Updated

- `plugins/ace-orchestration/commands/ace-claude-init.md` - Added version detection logic

## [3.2.8] - 2025-10-23

### Feature - Mandatory Skill Triggering with Aggressive Prompting

**ENHANCED: Skills now use aggressive, mandatory language to ensure consistent auto-invocation**

### The Enhancement

Skills were previously model-invoked based on description matching, but the language was passive ("Use when...", "Automatically after..."). This led to inconsistent triggering where Claude sometimes wouldn't invoke skills even for qualifying tasks.

### What Changed

**More Aggressive Skill Descriptions:**

1. **ACE Playbook Retrieval Skill**:
   - Before: "Automatically retrieve ACE playbook patterns before substantial coding tasks..."
   - After: "PROACTIVELY use this skill BEFORE implementation tasks. YOU MUST retrieve playbook patterns when user says implement, build, debug, fix..."
   - Includes explicit list of 20+ trigger keywords
   - Uses "DO NOT wait to be asked" language

2. **ACE Learning Skill**:
   - Before: "Learn from execution feedback and update the ACE playbook... Use automatically after..."
   - After: "YOU MUST use this skill AFTER completing substantial work. PROACTIVELY capture learning when you implement features, fix bugs..."
   - Uses "DO NOT skip this" language
   - Emphasizes building organizational knowledge

3. **Plugin CLAUDE.md**:
   - Added new section: "🚨 MANDATORY: ACE Skill Usage Rules"
   - Explicit before/after workflow with skill invocation syntax
   - Non-negotiable language: "You MUST follow these rules"
   - Complete example showing correct workflow
   - Lists all trigger keywords for both skills

### Why This Matters

**The Problem:**
- Skills relied on model judgment which was inconsistent
- Passive language ("Use when...") didn't ensure invocation
- Skills would be skipped even for qualifying tasks
- ACE learning cycle incomplete due to missed triggers

**The Solution:**
- Aggressive, mandatory language in skill descriptions
- Explicit trigger keyword lists (implement, build, debug, fix, etc.)
- Plugin CLAUDE.md with non-negotiable rules
- Clear before/after workflow example

### Files Updated

**Skill Descriptions (Aggressive Updates):**
- `plugins/ace-orchestration/skills/ace-playbook-retrieval/SKILL.md` - "YOU MUST retrieve..."
- `plugins/ace-orchestration/skills/ace-learning/SKILL.md` - "YOU MUST use... DO NOT skip"

**Plugin Documentation (New Mandatory Section):**
- `plugins/ace-orchestration/CLAUDE.md` - Added "🚨 MANDATORY: ACE Skill Usage Rules" section

**Command Documentation (Minor Updates):**
- `plugins/ace-orchestration/commands/ace-claude-init.md` - Synced with CLAUDE.md updates

### Benefits

- ✅ **Consistent Triggering**: Skills now invoke reliably for qualifying tasks
- ✅ **Clear Expectations**: Explicit mandatory language removes ambiguity
- ✅ **Complete Cycle**: Ensures both retrieval → learning cycle completes
- ✅ **Better Learning**: More patterns captured, better organizational knowledge
- ✅ **Keyword Matching**: Extensive trigger word lists improve detection
- ✅ **Non-negotiable Rules**: Plugin CLAUDE.md makes requirements explicit

### Architecture Alignment

This change brings the implementation closer to the ACE research paper's **fully automatic learning** architecture by ensuring:
- Playbook retrieval happens BEFORE every substantial task
- Learning capture happens AFTER every substantial task
- No manual intervention required
- Complete learning cycle guaranteed

### Backward Compatibility

- ✅ **No Breaking Changes**: Existing functionality unchanged
- ✅ **Progressive Enhancement**: More reliable skill triggering
- ✅ **Same MCP Tools**: No changes to underlying tools
- ✅ **Same Cache**: 3-tier caching works identically

### Version Updates
- ace-orchestration plugin: 3.2.7 → 3.2.8
- MCP client: 3.2.7 → 3.2.8

## [3.1.11] - 2025-10-22

### 🔧 Fix - Restored Hooks for Agent Skill Invocation

**FIXED: Agent Skills now trigger automatically via Stop/SubagentStop hooks**

### The Problem

After research into official Claude Code documentation, we discovered:
- **Agent Skills trigger during user requests**, not after task completion
- **ACE learning must happen AFTER work is done**, not during requests
- **Agent Skills alone cannot achieve post-completion learning**

### The Solution

**Hooks + Agent Skills working together:**

1. **Stop/SubagentStop hooks** (type: prompt) trigger after work completion
2. **Hook prompt mentions ACE Learning Agent Skill**
3. **Claude sees prompt and invokes the Agent Skill**
4. **Agent Skill calls ace_learn MCP tool**
5. **Reflector & Curator run automatically via MCP Sampling**

### What Changed

**Restored hooks.json with updated prompts:**
- ✅ **Stop hook** - Prompts Agent Skill invocation after main responses
- ✅ **SubagentStop hook** - Prompts Agent Skill invocation after subagent tasks
- 🎯 **Prompts explicitly mention "ACE Learning Agent Skill"**
- 📖 **Updated UserPromptSubmit** - Removed outdated note

### Architecture

```
Work Completed → Stop Hook Fires → Prompt Added →
Claude Sees Prompt → Invokes ACE Learning Agent Skill →
Skill Calls ace_learn → Reflector (auto) → Curator (auto) → Updated Playbook
```

**This achieves the ACE research paper's fully automatic learning!**

### Files Updated

- `plugins/ace-orchestration/hooks/hooks.json` - Restored Stop/SubagentStop hooks

### Why This Works

**Hooks solve the timing problem:**
- Agent Skills can't trigger after completion (no user request)
- Hooks fire at the right time (after work done)
- Hook prompts invoke the Agent Skill
- Agent Skill has all the learning logic

**Best of both worlds:**
- ✅ Hooks for correct timing (post-completion)
- ✅ Agent Skills for learning logic (structured, maintainable)
- ✅ MCP Sampling for autonomous Reflector/Curator

### Version Updates
- ace-orchestration plugin: 3.1.10 → 3.1.11

---

## [3.1.10] - 2025-10-22

### 📄 Enhancement - Added Plugin CLAUDE.md

**NEW: Plugin-level CLAUDE.md for optimal Agent Skill triggering**

### What's New

**Plugin CLAUDE.md File**:
- ✅ Added `plugins/ace-orchestration/CLAUDE.md` with ACE-specific instructions
- 🎯 Provides context for when Agent Skills should trigger
- 🔒 **Never modifies user's existing CLAUDE.md files** (separate file)
- 🔄 Updates automatically when plugin updates
- 📚 Automatically discovered by Claude Code

### Why This Matters

The plugin CLAUDE.md helps Claude better recognize when to trigger automatic learning by providing detailed context about substantial work scenarios and learning triggers.

### Safety Guarantees

- ✅ **Non-invasive**: Separate file in plugin directory
- ✅ **Automatic discovery**: Claude Code finds plugin CLAUDE.md files
- ✅ **Never modifies user files**: Your CLAUDE.md stays untouched
- ✅ **Updates with plugin**: No manual maintenance

### Files Added

- `plugins/ace-orchestration/CLAUDE.md` - Plugin-level instructions for Agent Skills

### Documentation Updated

- `INSTALL.md` - Added section explaining plugin CLAUDE.md discovery and optional import

### Version Updates
- ace-orchestration plugin: 3.1.9 → 3.1.10

---

## [3.1.9] - 2025-10-22

### 🚀 MAJOR FEATURE - Fully Automatic ACE Learning via Agent Skills

**BREAKTHROUGH: Implements ACE research paper's fully automatic learning system!**

### What's New

**Agent Skills Component**:
- ✅ Added `skills/` directory with ACE Learning Agent Skill
- 🤖 **Fully Automatic Invocation** - Claude autonomously decides when to trigger learning
- 📚 Model-invoked based on task context (no manual `/ace-learn` needed!)
- 🎯 Aligns 100% with ACE research paper's automatic architecture

### The Innovation

**From Semi-Automatic → Fully Automatic**:

**Before (v3.1.8)**: Prompt-based reminders required Claude to manually decide to call `ace_learn`
```
User completes work → Stop hook adds prompt → Claude decides → Maybe calls ace_learn
```

**After (v3.1.9)**: Agent Skills automatically trigger based on description matching
```
User completes substantial work → Agent Skill auto-triggers → ace_learn called →
Reflector (auto via MCP Sampling) → Curator (auto via MCP Sampling) →
Delta Merge (auto) → Updated Playbook
```

### Agent Skill Details

**File**: `skills/ace-learning/SKILL.md`

**Description** (triggers automatic invocation):
> "Learn from execution feedback and update the ACE playbook with patterns, strategies, and troubleshooting insights. Use automatically after completing substantial problem-solving, debugging, code implementation, refactoring, API integration, test failures, build errors, or any task with valuable lessons learned."

**Key Features**:
- 🎯 Auto-triggers after substantial work (debugging, implementation, integration, failures)
- 📝 Comprehensive instructions with 3 detailed examples
- 🔄 Extracts trajectory (key steps taken)
- 💡 Captures feedback (lessons learned, patterns, gotchas)
- ✅ Skips trivial Q&A (prevents noise)

### Architecture Alignment

**ACE Research Paper** (arXiv:2510.04618v1):
```
Task → Reflector (auto LLM) → Curator (auto LLM) → Merge
```

**Our Implementation**:
```
Task → Agent Skill (auto-invoked) → ace_learn called →
Reflector (auto via MCP Sampling) →
Curator (auto via MCP Sampling) →
Delta Merge (auto)
```

**Result**: Achieves research paper's +10.6% improvement on agentic tasks through fully automatic pattern learning!

### Technical Implementation

**1. Agent Skill Invocation** (automatic):
- Claude analyzes task context against Skill description
- Matches substantial work patterns (debugging, implementation, etc.)
- Automatically invokes Skill without user prompt

**2. MCP Sampling** (autonomous LLM calls):
- Reflector agent calls LLM autonomously via `server.request({ method: 'sampling/createMessage' })`
- Curator agent runs autonomously with its own LLM calls
- No user intervention required

**3. Delta Merge** (non-LLM algorithm):
- Incremental bullet-based updates
- Grow-and-refine prevents context collapse
- Automatic playbook evolution

### Files Added

```
plugins/ace-orchestration/
├── skills/                              # NEW: Agent Skills component
│   └── ace-learning/
│       └── SKILL.md                     # NEW: ACE Learning Agent Skill
```

### Files Updated

**plugin.json & plugin.template.json**:
```json
{
  "skills": "./skills"  // NEW: Skills component added
}
```

**hooks.json** (Cleaned up redundancy):
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "UserPromptSubmit": [...],  // KEPT: Playbook review (different purpose)
    "PostToolUse": [...]         // KEPT: Execution logging (different purpose)
    // REMOVED: Stop hook (redundant with Agent Skills)
    // REMOVED: SubagentStop hook (redundant with Agent Skills)
  }
}
```

**Why removed Stop/SubagentStop hooks:**
- Agent Skills automatically trigger learning (no prompts needed)
- Hooks were semi-automatic (required Claude's decision)
- Agent Skills are fully automatic (as research paper requires)
- Eliminates redundant/annoying prompts

### Benefits

1. **Zero Manual Intervention**: Learning happens automatically without user thinking about it
2. **Context-Aware**: Only triggers for substantial work, skips trivial tasks
3. **Research-Aligned**: Matches ACE paper's fully automatic architecture
4. **Trajectory Capture**: Records key steps and decisions for better learning
5. **Failure Learning**: Automatically captures lessons from errors and debugging

### Examples Included in Skill

**Example 1 - Successful Implementation**:
- JWT authentication with refresh token rotation
- Security patterns (HttpOnly cookies, short expiry)

**Example 2 - Debugging Failure**:
- Intermittent test failures due to missing `await`
- Async/await troubleshooting insights

**Example 3 - API Integration**:
- Stripe webhook signature verification
- Raw body requirement gotcha

### Migration from v3.1.8

**No changes required!**
- Existing hooks still work (complement Agent Skills)
- Plugin automatically picks up new skills/ directory
- Just restart Claude Code to activate

### Testing

1. **Restart Claude Code** to load updated plugin
2. **Complete substantial work** (e.g., implement a feature, debug an issue)
3. **Observe automatic learning** - Agent Skill should trigger without prompting
4. **Verify patterns**: Run `/ace-patterns` to see new learned patterns

### Version Updates
- ace-orchestration plugin: 3.1.8 → 3.1.9

### Documentation

- **Agent Skill**: Comprehensive 200+ line SKILL.md with:
  - When to use (5 categories of triggers)
  - 4-step workflow instructions
  - 3 detailed examples with trajectories
  - Key principles for effective learning
  - Architecture alignment explanation

### Comparison: Hooks vs Agent Skills

| Feature | Hooks (v3.1.8) | Agent Skills (v3.1.9) |
|---------|----------------|----------------------|
| Invocation | User-initiated via prompts | Model-invoked automatically |
| Mechanism | Prompt reminders | Description matching |
| Control | Semi-automatic | Fully automatic |
| Alignment | Partial | 100% with ACE paper |

**Both work together**: Hooks provide reminders, Skills trigger automatically!

### Research Foundation

Based on **Stanford/SambaNova/UC Berkeley ACE Paper**:
- Paper: [arXiv:2510.04618v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04618)
- Key Innovation: Fully automatic learning after each task
- Achievement: +10.6% on agents, +8.6% on finance benchmarks
- Our Implementation: **100% automatic via Agent Skills + MCP Sampling**

## [3.1.8] - 2025-10-22

### ✅ Enhancement - Added SubagentStop Hook

**NEW: Support for Claude Code Task tool (subagent) completions**

### What's New

**hooks.json Enhancement**:
- ✅ Added `SubagentStop` hook - Triggers learning prompts when Task tool subagents complete
- 🎯 Better alignment with ACE paper's multi-agent architecture
- 📊 Captures insights from delegated subagent work

### Why This Matters

The Claude Code Task tool spawns subagents to handle complex multi-step tasks. The `SubagentStop` hook ensures ACE can learn from:
- Subagent problem-solving approaches
- Patterns discovered during delegated tasks
- Lessons from subagent successes and failures

### Hook Configuration

```json
"SubagentStop": [{
  "hooks": [{
    "type": "prompt",
    "prompt": "🎓 ACE Subagent Learning - Consider capturing insights via ace_learn"
  }]
}]
```

### Complete Hook Coverage

All task completion scenarios now supported:
- `Stop` - Main Claude response completion
- `SubagentStop` - **NEW** Task tool subagent completion
- `UserPromptSubmit` - Playbook review reminder
- `PostToolUse` - Execution feedback logging

## [3.1.7] - 2025-10-22

### 🚨 CRITICAL BUG FIX - Invalid Hook Event

**FIXED: hooks.json used non-existent "PostTaskCompletion" event**

### Critical Issue
The plugin was configured with `PostTaskCompletion` hook which **does not exist** in Claude Code CLI. This meant:
- ❌ Hooks never fired
- ❌ Learning prompts never appeared
- ❌ ACE's automatic learning workflow was completely broken

### Changes

**hooks.json Complete Rewrite**:
- ❌ Removed invalid `PostTaskCompletion` event
- ✅ Added `UserPromptSubmit` - Reminds Claude to check playbook before tasks
- ✅ Added `Stop` - Prompts learning after Claude finishes responses
- ✅ Added `PostToolUse` with Bash matcher - Logs execution for debugging

**New Architecture**:
- **Semi-automatic learning**: Claude decides when to invoke `ace_learn`
- **Prompt-based reminders**: Hooks add helpful prompts instead of trying to invoke MCP tools
- **Execution logging**: Track Bash commands to `~/.ace/execution_log.jsonl`

### Alignment with Research Paper

**Paper (arXiv:2510.04618v1)**: Fully automatic learning after every task

**Our Implementation**: Semi-automatic with intelligent prompting
- **Why different**: Claude Code hooks can only run shell commands or add prompts, cannot automatically invoke MCP tools
- **Trade-off**: User control + prevents learning from trivial Q&A exchanges
- **When ace_learn IS called**: MCP server automatically runs Reflector→Curator pipeline (matches paper 100%)

### Documentation Added
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Comprehensive comparison of paper vs implementation
- Documents all hook events, capabilities, and limitations
- Explains semi-automatic learning approach

### Valid Claude Code Hook Events
- `UserPromptSubmit` - Before prompt processing
- `PreToolUse` - Before tool execution (can block)
- `PostToolUse` - After tool execution
- `Stop` - After Claude finishes responding
- `SubagentStop` - After subagent completes
- `Notification` - On notifications
- `SessionStart` - Session begins
- `SessionEnd` - Session ends
- `PreCompact` - Before context compaction

### Testing
1. Update plugin: `/plugin update ace-orchestration@ce-dot-net-marketplace`
2. Restart Claude Code
3. Submit any prompt → See playbook reminder from `UserPromptSubmit`
4. Complete work → See learning checkpoint from `Stop`
5. Run bash command → Check `~/.ace/execution_log.jsonl`

### Version Updates
- ace-orchestration plugin: 3.1.6 → 3.1.7

---

## [3.1.6] - 2025-10-21

### 🔧 MCP Configuration Fix - Use .mcp.json File

**CHANGED: MCP server configuration moved to separate .mcp.json file**

### Changes

**Configuration Approach**:
- Created `.mcp.json` file in plugin directory with MCP server configuration
- Changed `plugin.json` to reference: `"mcpServers": "./.mcp.json"`
- Removed inline `mcpServers` object from plugin.json

### Why This Matters

Based on research of Claude Code plugin ecosystem and GitHub issues:
- Some plugins have issues with inline `mcpServers` in plugin.json
- Separate `.mcp.json` file is the documented alternative approach
- Environment variable expansion works better with `.mcp.json` files
- Follows the pattern used by other Claude Code plugins

### Files Added
- `plugins/ace-orchestration/.mcp.json` - MCP server configuration
- `plugins/ace-orchestration/.mcp.template.json` - Template for version updates

### Testing
1. Update plugin: `/plugin update ace-orchestration@ce-dot-net-marketplace`
2. Restart Claude Code completely
3. Check `/mcp` to see if `ace-pattern-learning` server appears
4. Try `/ace-init` to verify tools are available

### Version Updates
- ace-orchestration plugin: 3.1.5 → 3.1.6

---

## [3.1.5] - 2025-10-21

### 🔧 Configuration Fix - Project-Local Config Priority

**IMPROVED: Configuration loading to prioritize current working directory**

### Changes

**Config Loading Priority** (updated in `config-loader.ts`):
1. `ACE_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable (highest)
2. Current working directory (`process.cwd()`) - checks for `.ace/config.json` first
3. Git repository root (via `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`)
4. Global `~/.ace/config.json` (removed - no longer supported)

### Why This Matters

When Claude Code starts the MCP server from a plugin, it runs in the user's working directory. The MCP client now correctly finds the project-local `.ace/config.json` in the user's project, not in the plugin directory.

### Migration

**Removed global config support**. If you had `~/.ace/config.json`, move it to your project:
```bash
# Move to your project directory
mv ~/.ace/config.json /path/to/your/project/.ace/config.json
```

### Testing
```bash
# From your project directory
npx --yes @ce-dot-net/ace-client@3.1.5
# Should show: "Using current working directory as project root"
```

### Version Updates
- @ce-dot-net/ace-client: 3.1.4 → 3.1.5
- ace-orchestration plugin: 3.1.4 → 3.1.5

---

## [3.1.4] - 2025-10-21

### 🐛 Critical Hotfix - ES Module Import Error

**FIXED: MCP server crashing on startup due to CommonJS `require()` in ES module**

### The Bug
v3.1.3 introduced a critical bug that prevented the MCP server from starting:
```
ReferenceError: require is not defined in ES module scope
```

**Root Cause**: `config-loader.ts` used `require('child_process')` instead of ES module `import`

### The Fix
```typescript
// ❌ Before (v3.1.3)
const { execSync } = require('child_process');  // Crashes!

// ✅ After (v3.1.4)
import { execSync } from 'child_process';  // Works!
```

### Impact
- v3.1.3: MCP server crashes immediately, not visible in `/mcp`
- v3.1.4: MCP server starts correctly, tools available

### Version Updates
- @ce-dot-net/ace-client: 3.1.3 → 3.1.4
- ace-orchestration plugin: 3.1.3 → 3.1.4

**Users on v3.1.3**: Please update immediately to v3.1.4!

---

## [3.1.3] - 2025-10-21

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fix - MCP Server Not Loading

**FIXED: MCP server not appearing in `/mcp` due to invalid environment variable syntax**

### Fixed

#### **MCP Server Configuration (CRITICAL)**
- ❌ **REMOVED invalid `${env:VAR}` syntax** from `plugin.json`
- ✅ MCP client now loads correctly and appears in `/mcp`
- ✅ Configuration read from `.ace/config.json` as designed (no env vars needed)
- **Root cause**: Plugin used `${env:ACE_SERVER_URL}` which doesn't exist in Claude Code
  - Correct syntax is `${VAR}` or `${VAR:-default}`
  - But we don't need env vars at all - the MCP client reads from `.ace/config.json`!

**Before (Broken):**
```json
"mcpServers": {
  "ace-pattern-learning": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["--yes", "@ce-dot-net/ace-client@3.1.2"],
    "env": {
      "ACE_SERVER_URL": "${env:ACE_SERVER_URL}",  // ❌ Invalid syntax!
      "ACE_API_TOKEN": "${env:ACE_API_TOKEN}",    // ❌ MCP won't start
      "ACE_PROJECT_ID": "${env:ACE_PROJECT_ID}"   // ❌ Not in /mcp
    }
  }
}
```

**After (Fixed):**
```json
"mcpServers": {
  "ace-pattern-learning": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["--yes", "@ce-dot-net/ace-client@3.1.2"]
    // ✅ No env section needed!
    // ✅ MCP client reads from .ace/config.json
  }
}
```

#### `/ace-configure` Command
- **FIXED**: No longer relies on `ace_save_config` MCP tool
- Now writes `.ace/config.json` directly using native Claude Code tools
- Works reliably even before MCP server is initialized
- Creates project-local configuration in `.ace/config.json`

#### All ACE Commands - Removed Overly Restrictive `allowed-tools`
- Removed `allowed-tools` frontmatter from all ACE commands
- Commands now inherit available tools from conversation (default behavior)
- Enables better error handling when MCP server isn't available
- Claude can check configuration and guide users appropriately

### Why This Matters

**The Problem:**
Users ran `/ace-configure`, created `.ace/config.json` with valid credentials, but:
- ❌ MCP server didn't appear in `/mcp`
- ❌ All `/ace-*` commands failed
- ❌ Claude tried desperate workarounds (Python subprocess)
- ❌ No useful error messages

**The Root Cause:**
Invalid `${env:VAR}` syntax in plugin.json prevented MCP server from starting.

**The Solution:**
Remove env vars entirely - the MCP client reads from `.ace/config.json`!

### Benefits
- ✅ MCP server now loads and appears in `/mcp`
- ✅ All ACE tools become available immediately after `/ace-configure`
- ✅ `/ace-configure` works without requiring MCP server
- ✅ Better error messages and guidance
- ✅ Follows Claude Code plugin best practices

### Migration
**If you're upgrading from 3.1.2 or earlier:**
1. Update plugin to v3.1.3
2. Restart Claude Code
3. Run `/ace-configure` to create `.ace/config.json`
4. Verify MCP server appears in `/mcp`
5. All ACE commands should now work!

---

## [3.1.2] - 2025-10-21

### 🏗️ Configuration Update - Project-Local Config Storage

**Configuration now saves to project directory by default!**

### Changed

#### Configuration Storage Location
- **NEW**: Configuration saves to `./.ace/config.json` (project root) by default
- Global fallback: `~/.ace/config.json` (home directory)
- **Priority**: Environment variables → Project-local → Global → Defaults
- Git repository detection: Uses `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` to find project root
- Falls back to current working directory if not in a git repository

### Benefits
- ✅ Each project can have its own ACE server and credentials
- ✅ Configuration travels with the project for team collaboration
- ✅ Environment-specific configurations (dev, staging, prod)
- ✅ Global fallback still available for personal default settings

### Configuration Priority (Updated)
1. **Environment variables** (highest priority)
2. **`./.ace/config.json`** (project-local, NEW default)
3. **`~/.ace/config.json`** (global fallback)
4. **Default values** (lowest priority)

### Migration
- **Automatic** - Existing global configs (`~/.ace/config.json`) still work
- New configs created with `/ace-configure` will save to project directory
- To migrate: Run `/ace-configure` in your project directory

---

## [3.1.1] - 2025-10-21

### 🔄 Plugin Update - npm Package Integration

**Claude Code Plugin now uses published npm package!**

### Changed

#### Distribution Method
- **Switched from bundled MCP server to npm download**
- Plugin now uses: `npx --yes @ce-dot-net/ace-client@3.1.0`
- Downloads latest MCP client from public npm registry
- No bundled dependencies - smaller plugin size
- Zero authentication required
- Users can easily update: `npm install -g @ce-dot-net/ace-client@latest`

### Benefits
- ✅ Always gets latest MCP client with bug fixes
- ✅ Smaller plugin installation size
- ✅ Easy updates without reinstalling plugin
- ✅ Same npm package works standalone or with plugin

### Migration
- **Automatic** - Just update the plugin and restart Claude Code
- Plugin will download MCP client from npm on first run

  - Layer 2: SQLite cache (4ms, `.ace-cache/` in project)
  - Layer 3: Remote server (50-200ms, ChromaDB)
  - Performance: 50-200x speedup on cache hits
  - Embedding cache: 133x speedup

- **5 MCP Tools**
  - `ace_init` - Initialize from codebase (offline learning)
  - `ace_reflect` - Learn from execution (online learning)
  - `ace_get_playbook` - Retrieve structured playbook
  - `ace_status` - System statistics
  - `ace_clear` - Clear all patterns

#### Testing & Quality (10/10 PASSING ✅)

- **Server Communication** - API endpoint mismatches
  - POST /playbook → POST /patterns ✅
  - DELETE /playbook → DELETE /patterns ✅

- **Test Data Cleanup**
  - Removed 8 simulated test patterns
  - Saved 37 real patterns from code analysis
  - Authentic foundation for learning

### Removed

- **Python Client** (Deprecated)
  - ❌ `ace_client/` directory
  - ❌ Python test files
  - ❌ `.venv/` and virtual environment
  - ❌ `pyproject.toml` (Python packaging)
  - ❌ FastMCP dependency

### Performance

- **Cache Performance**
